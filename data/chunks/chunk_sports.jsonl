Cope urged fans to take yellow dish towels to the game and wave them throughout. The stands were filled that day and the Steelers always seemed to complete terrific plays when the towels were waving. The Steelers won, 28-10. The team moved on in the playoffs and for Super Bowl X in January 1976, the Steelers introduced gold towels with the words \"Myron Cope's Terrible Towel\" printed in black. The Steelers went on to beat the Dallas Cowboys, 21-17, many claiming, \"thanks to the Towel.\"\nIn 1996 Mr. Cope gave the rights to \"Myron Cope's Official Terrible Towel\" to the Allegheny Valley School in the Pittsburgh suburb of Coraopolis. The school provides care for more than 900 children, adults and senior citizens with mental retardation and physical disabilities. Proceeds from the Terrible Towel have helped raise almost $1.1 million for the school. On Jan. 15, 2005, during the Steelers playoff run at Acrisure Stadium, VisitPittsburgh sponsored the \"World's Largest Terrible Towel Wave,\" reaching millions of Steelers fans around the world, known amongst themselves as \"Steelers Nation.\" The team came back from what appeared to be a sure loss against the New York Jets, winning the game in overtime, 20-17. It appeared that the Towel had done it again.\nThe Steelers went on to host another home game the following week, Jan. 23, 2005, vs. the Patriots. Another massive Terrible Towel Wave was organized but this time the Steelers lost, 41-27. The victors that day went on to win Super Bowl XXXIX in Jacksonville. But the Steelers didn't give up on the Terrible Towel. On Halloween, Oct. 31, 2005, a special Terrible Towel was created to honor the retired Cope for his 35 years as a Steelers broadcaster and was waved prior to the Monday Night Football game between the Steelers and the Baltimore Ravens at Heinz Field (now named Acrisure Stadium). A limited edition of 35,000 were made, all with familiar \"Cope-isms\" like \"Yoi!\" By the way, that night, the Steelers won, 20-19.\nFor Super Bowl XL, played on Feb. 5, 2006 in Detroit, a special edition Terrible Towel was created for fans around Steelers Nation to help the team to victory. It worked! The Steelers beat the Seattle Seahawks, 21-10. Sadly, Myron passed away on Feb. 27, 2008 but his legend lives on. For Super Bowl XLIII, Feb. 1, 2009 in Tampa, another towel was produced to mark the occasion. The outcome? Steelers over Arizona, 27-23, to give them an unprecedented six Super Bowl Championships.\nOn Sunday, Jan. 23, 2011, the Steelers not only beat the New York Jets in the AFC Championship to advance to their third Super Bowl in six years, the game was played on what would have been Myron's 82nd birthday. Somehow that just seems so right. Those who knew and loved Myron, friends and fans alike, know he’s somewhere smiling and cheering, \"Here We Go Steelers, Here We Go!\"\nThe Terrible Towels will be out in force Christmas weekend 2022. The Immaculate Reception, the greatest play in NFL history, fittingly celebrates its (black and) golden 50th anniversary with festivities reuniting Steelers legends from that era during a rematch against the Raiders at Acisure Stadium on Dec. 24, 2022."}

{"chunk_id": "0009", "text": "The History of the Steelers Logo\n\nWhen it comes to key dates in Steelers history, none is more important than **July 8, 1933**, when **Art Rooney Sr.** founded the franchise. For its first seven years, the team was called the **Pittsburgh Pirates**, but before the **1940 season**, Rooney renamed it the **Steelers** to honor the city’s steel heritage.\n\nTo commemorate the new name, Rooney received a plaque featuring a football-shaped design surrounded by the words *“Pittsburgh Steelers Football Club.”* While NFL logos didn’t exist at that time, Rooney liked the design, and it became the team’s first logo—used primarily as letterhead.\n\nIn the **late 1950s**, as the NFL began expanding its fan base, **Dan Rooney** encouraged the team to develop a public-facing logo. This led to the creation of the **“Man on the Beam”** design, symbolizing the city’s steelworkers. The logo gained recognition through newspapers and reappeared in **1998** when the NFL launched its throwback merchandise program.\n\nBy **1962**, the Steelers made a historic change. **Republic Steel**, based in Cleveland, offered the franchise the **Steelmark** logo—a design created by the **American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI)**. The Steelmark features a circular emblem with three colored **hypocycloids** (yellow, orange, and blue) and the word *“Steel.”* Each color represents a key element in steel production:\n- **Yellow** – Coal\n- **Orange (later red)** – Iron ore\n- **Blue** – Steel scrap\n\nInitially, the Steelers placed the Steelmark logo on only one side of their **gold helmets** as a test. When the 1962 season ended successfully (9-5 record and a Playoff Bowl appearance), Rooney decided to switch to **black helmets**, finding that the logo stood out better. \n\nThe team then received permission from the AISI to replace the word *“Steel”* with *“Steelers,”* and the orange hypocycloid was changed to red. This version of the **Steelers logo**, introduced in **1962**, remains **unchanged to this day**—a lasting tribute to Pittsburgh’s steel industry and the team’s enduring identity."}

Its reputation for bringing “mystical powers” even led other teams to distribute their own towels in response.\n\nThe Terrible Towel isn’t just waved—it’s cherished.

{"chunk_id": "0047", "text": "The Ballpark\nPNC Park, which opened in spring 2001, is a classic-style ballpark, an intimate facility that embraces the progressiveness of Pittsburgh while saluting the spirit of early ballpark originals such as Forbes Field, Wrigley Field and Fenway Park. It is the fifth home of the Pittsburgh Pirates since their inception in 1887.\n\nThis riverfront facility combines the best features of yesterday's ballparks - rhythmic archways, steel trusswork and a natural grass playing field - with the latest in fan and player amenities and comfort.\n\nLocation\nPNC Park's prime location along the shore of the Allegheny River and adjacent to Federal Street takes advantage of scenic vistas of the downtown skyline and riverfront, as well as pedestrian and riverboat access, creating an exciting and dramatic urban sports venue. It also provides easy access for pedestrians crossing the Roberto Clemente Bridge from downtown, as well as those arriving from the riverwalk. On game days, the bridge is closed off to vehicular traffic and spectators are met by a dynamic interactive retail/restaurant and sports pavilion beyond right field, with attractions for all ages.\n\nDesign\nThe facility was designed by Hellmuth, Obata and Kassabaum (HOK), Inc. out of Kansas City, MO. The design and construction management team consisted of a joint venture between Pittsburgh-based Dick Corporation and Barton Malow with offices in Baltimore, MD. The Architect of Record was L.D. Astorino & Associates of Pittsburgh.\nPNC Park is the first ballpark with a two-deck design to be built in the United States since Milwaukee's County Stadium was completed in 1953. Because of its intimate design, the highest seat is just 88 feet from the field, giving every fan in the park an ideal sight line.\nPNC Park is approachable and pedestrian in scale. Designed to fit within the existing city grid, it is also orientated to allow a great majority of spectators a spectacular view of the Clemente Bridge and the downtown skyline beyond.\nThe home of the Pirates is instantly recognizable as a ballpark, with architectural flourishes of Forbes Field lending a touch of nostalgia. The series of masonry archways extending along the entry level facade and decorative terra cotta tiled pilasters exude the charm of the club's former home of 61 years.\n\nFeatures\nAmong the features of the beautiful facility are 69 suites with their own concourse level, club seating at both the field and mezzanine levels with their own respective lounges, an outfield barbecue run by former Pirate Manny Sanguillen, an outdoor river terrace and river walk. PNC Park also features the Left Field Lounge & Jim Beam Porch, offering a casual dining and sports bar atmosphere with wait service before, during and after every game for all ticket holders. The ballpark houses retail areas along the Federal Street and General Robinson Street corridor, including Slice on Broadway, the Pirates Clubhouse Store, PNC Bank and the Pirates administrative and ticket offices.\n\nPlaying Field\nThe irregularly shaped, natural grass playing field measures 325 feet down the left foul line and 389 feet through the left field power alley. The park reaches its greatest distance of 410 feet at a nook located just left of center field. The distance down the right field foul line is 320 feet, 375 feet down the power alley, and 399 feet to center field. The outfield wall rises up to 21 feet behind right field (in honor of the Pirates legendary right fielder #21, Roberto Clemente) and drops down to just six feet in front of the left field bleachers. From home plate to the Allegheny River is 443 feet, 4 inches.\n\nThe Pirates and the Park\nPerhaps the strongest inspiration for PNC Park's design is the legacy of the Pirates themselves. Few cities can boast of a 115-year relationship with the same Major League ballclub. Pittsburgh deserves nothing less than a ballpark classic that will enthrall fans for generations to come."}
{"chunk_id": "0048", "text": "Opening and Previous Homes\nPNC Park, which opened on April 9, 2001, is the fifth home of the Pittsburgh Pirates since their inception in 1887.\nThe fledgling National League franchise first began play at Recreation Park, located at the corners of Grant and Pennsylvania Avenues along the Fort Wayne railroad tracks on the North Side.
