The Steelers are the **fifth-oldest team** in the National Football League.\n\nAt their founding, the Steelers joined the NFL’s **Eastern Division** as one of only 10 teams in the league. Of those original teams, only five still remain today: the **Steelers**, **Chicago (Arizona) Cardinals**, **Green Bay Packers**, **Chicago Bears**, and **New York Giants**.\n\nFrom humble beginnings to greatness, the Steelers have grown into one of the league’s most successful franchises. Today, they are **tied for the most Super Bowl titles (6)** and boast **27 members of the Pro Football Hall of Fame**, including **Bill Cowher**, **Troy Polamalu**, and **Donnie Shell**, who were part of the **Class of 2020** enshrined in 2021.\n\n### 90 Years of This & That\n- **Super Bowl Bling:** The Steelers’ six Super Bowl victories — **IX, X, XIII, XIV, XL,** and **XLIII** — are marked by increasingly elaborate championship rings, symbols of the team’s enduring dominance.\n- **Love the Look:** Over 90 years, the Steelers’ uniform has evolved from the simple 1933 original into one of the most iconic designs in all of sports. Fans proudly identify with the black and gold that defines Pittsburgh.\n- **Squad Goals:** Team photos have captured generations of players united in pride and purpose. From the early years to today, every player wearing the Steelers jersey represents a piece of a proud, unbroken legacy.\n\nFrom **Art Rooney’s vision** to **90 years of championship tradition**, the Pittsburgh Steelers’ story continues to stand as a symbol of perseverance, pride, and excellence in professional football."}
{"chunk_id": "0076", "source": "user_uploaded_txt", "text": "The History of the Steelers Logo\n\nWhen it comes to key dates in Steelers history, none is more important than **July 8, 1933**, when **Art Rooney Sr.** founded the franchise. For its first seven years, the team was called the **Pittsburgh Pirates**, but before the **1940 season**, Rooney renamed it the **Steelers** to honor the city’s steel heritage.\n\nTo commemorate the new name, Rooney received a plaque featuring a football-shaped design surrounded by the words *“Pittsburgh Steelers Football Club.”* While NFL logos didn’t exist at that time, Rooney liked the design, and it became the team’s first logo—used primarily as letterhead.\n\nIn the **late 1950s**, as the NFL began expanding its fan base, **Dan Rooney** encouraged the team to develop a public-facing logo. This led to the creation of the **“Man on the Beam”** design, symbolizing the city’s steelworkers. The logo gained recognition through newspapers and reappeared in **1998** when the NFL launched its throwback merchandise program.\n\nBy **1962**, the Steelers made a historic change. **Republic Steel**, based in Cleveland, offered the franchise the **Steelmark** logo—a design created by the **American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI)**. The Steelmark features a circular emblem with three colored **hypocycloids** (yellow, orange, and blue) and the word *“Steel.”* Each color represents a key element in steel production:\n- **Yellow** – Coal\n- **Orange (later red)** – Iron ore\n- **Blue** – Steel scrap\n\nInitially, the Steelers placed the Steelmark logo on only one side of their **gold helmets** as a test. When the 1962 season ended successfully (9-5 record and a Playoff Bowl appearance), Rooney decided to switch to **black helmets**, finding that the logo stood out better. \n\nThe team then received permission from the AISI to replace the word *“Steel”* with *“Steelers,”* and the orange hypocycloid was changed to red. This version of the **Steelers logo**, introduced in **1962**, remains **unchanged to this day**—a lasting tribute to Pittsburgh’s steel industry and the team’s enduring identity."}
{"chunk_id": "0077", "source": "user_uploaded_txt", "text": "The Terrible Towel: A Steelers Icon\n\nNothing unites or identifies a **Steelers fan** more than the **Terrible Towel**, an enduring symbol of pride, passion, and tradition. Passed down through generations or gifted to newborn fans, the Terrible Towel has become an essential part of Steelers culture.\n\nThe idea originated in **1975** when former Steelers radio announcer **Myron Cope** created it during the playoffs to rally fans. The towel quickly became a good luck charm as the Steelers went on to win **Super Bowl X** over the Dallas Cowboys. From that moment, the Terrible Towel became a staple of Pittsburgh football and one of the most recognized fan symbols in sports.\n\nSince its creation, the Terrible Towel has appeared everywhere—from **Three Rivers Stadium** to **Heinz Field** (now Acrisure Stadium)—and beyond. Players often wave it during introductions to energize the home crowd, while fans proudly display it at away games, filling opposing stadiums with waves of black and gold. Its reputation for bringing “mystical powers” even led other teams to distribute their own towels in response.\n\nThe Terrible Towel isn’t just waved—it’s cherished. Babies are wrapped in it at birth, couples celebrate weddings with it, and fans take it on journeys around the world—from the **Great Wall of China** to the **Vatican**, the **South Pole**, and even **outer space**, when **Astronaut Colonel Mike Fincke**, a Pittsburgh native, waved one aboard the **International Space Station**.\n\nOver time, special editions of the Terrible Towel have been released, including versions commemorating **Super Bowl Championships**, **breast cancer awareness (pink towel)**, **camouflage editions**, and **holiday designs** for **Christmas**, **Halloween**, and **St. Patrick’s Day**.\n\nIn **2010**, the Steelers introduced a new game-day tradition at Heinz Field: the **“Terrible Towel Twirl.”** Each game features a special guest leading the crowd in a synchronized twirl, with past participants including **Dermontti Dawson**, **Alan Faneca**, **Billy Gardell**, **Joe Manganiello**, **Jesse Williams**, **Alyssa Milano**, **Tamara Tunie**, **Jane Seymour**, **Wiz Khalifa**, and **Buzz Aldrin**.\n\nA portion of every Terrible Towel sale benefits the **Allegheny Valley School** in Pittsburgh, a charity close to **Myron Cope’s** heart. Today, the Terrible Towel remains a powerful emblem of Steelers Nation—flying proudly wherever Pittsburgh pride goes."}

Notably, **Purple Heart recipients** joined **Joe Greene**, and guests of **Operation Once In A Lifetime** waved towels alongside **Alyssa Milano**.\n\nEach **October**, the Steelers introduce a **pink Terrible Towel** in honor of **Breast Cancer Awareness Month**.
