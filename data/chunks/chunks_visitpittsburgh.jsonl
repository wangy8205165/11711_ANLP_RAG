Its location alone made it a hotbed of conflict between the\nFrench and British empires, eventually sparking the French and Indian War. The\nfight for control over this gateway to the west, from the building of Fort\nDuquesne to Fort Pitt, directly fueled the tensions that would explode into\nthe American Revolution.  \n  \nThe early drama right here in Pittsburgh played a significant part in shaping\nthe colonies and helping to forge a new American identity. As a young officer,\nGeorge Washington got some of his most valuable military experience right\nhere. The intense competition for this land, and how it opened up westward\nexpansion, set the stage for the independent spirit and big dreams that would\ndefine the brand new United States. It's clear: Pittsburgh was a true crucible\nin the forging of America.  \n  \nSince those foundational days, Pittsburgh has kept right on being a powerhouse\nof American progress, totally evolving from its early frontier roots. It\nquickly became the \"Steel City,\" practically building the Industrial\nRevolution with its massive output of iron and steel. This incredible\nindustrial muscle built the very backbone of our nation – think railroads,\nskyscrapers, and bridges – and drew in waves of immigrants, making our city's\nculture so rich and adding to America's diverse tapestry."}

This enduring spirit of innovation and adaptability keeps shaping\nAmerica's future, proving Pittsburgh's lasting impact on our country's\neconomy, technology, and society."}

I think of all\nthe pumpkin patches I've been to in the Pittsburgh area, Trax has the best\nselection of pumpkins even as Halloween draws closer; I've gone as close as\nfour days before Halloween and still got several pumpkins that I carved.
