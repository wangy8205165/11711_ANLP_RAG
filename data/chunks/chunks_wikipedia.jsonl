He leveled the houses outside\nthe ramparts and ordered all settlers into the fort: 330 men, 104 women, and\n196 children sought refuge inside its ramparts.[11] Captain Ecuyer also\ngathered stores, which included hundreds of barrels of pork and beef.\nPontiac's forces attacked the fort on June 22, 1763, and the siege of Fort\nPitt lasted for two months.[15] Pontiac's warriors kept up a continuous,\nthough ineffective, fire on it from July 27 through August 1, 1763.[21] They\ndrew off to confront the relieving party under Colonel Bouquet, which defeated\nthem in the Battle of Bushy Run.[21] This victory ensured British dominion\nover the forks of the Ohio, if not the entire Ohio valley. In 1764 Colonel\nBouquet added a redoubt, the Fort Pitt Blockhouse, which still stands, the\nsole remaining structure from Fort Pitt and the oldest authenticated building\nwest of the Allegheny Mountains.[15]"}

The new\nindustrial Pittsburgh was based on integrated mills, mass production, and\nmodern management organization in steel and other industries.

Some owners removed their plants from the\ncentral city's labor unions to exert greater control over workers. The\nregion's rugged topography and dispersed natural resources of coal and gas\naccentuated this dispersal. The rapid growth of steel, glass, railroad\nequipment, and coke industries resulted in both large mass-production plants\nand numerous smaller firms. As capital deepened and interdependence grew,\nparticipants multiplied, economies accrued, the division of labor increased,\nand localized production systems formed around these industries.\nTransportation, capital, labor markets, and the division of labor in\nproduction bound the scattered industrial plants and communities into a\nsprawling metropolitan district.
