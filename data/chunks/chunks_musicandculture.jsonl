Time left to complete order Manfred Honeck Music Director Manfred Honeck has firmly established himself as one of the world’s leading conductors, renowned for his distinctive and revelatory interpretations that have garnered international acclaim. As Music Director of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, where he has now started his 18th season, he continues to shape the orchestra’s artistic identity with a deep sense of purpose and passion. His tenure, extended through the 2027–2028 season, has seen the orchestra flourish both artistically and as a cultural ambassador for the city of Pittsburgh. Celebrated at home and abroad, guest appearances under his leadership include Carnegie Hall and Lincoln Center in New York, as well as the major venues of Europe and leading festivals such as the BBC Proms, Salzburg Festival, Musikfest Berlin, Lucerne Festival, Rheingau Music Festival, and Grafenegg Festival. In summer 2024, he led the orchestra in a nine-city European Festivals Tour, beginning with their appearance as the only American orchestra at the prestigious Salzburg Festival and concluding at Vienna Konzerthaus. Manfred Honeck’s successful tenure in Pittsburgh is extensively documented by a series of recordings on the Reference Recordings label, featuring works by Beethoven, Brahms, Bruckner, Shostakovich, Strauss, Tchaikovsky, and others. They have received widespread critical acclaim and multiple GRAMMY® nominations, including a win for “Best Orchestral Performance” in 2018. In August 2025, he and the orchestra released Requiem: Mozart’s Death in Words and Music, an original concept imagining a Funeral Mass for Mozart, combining the composer’s Requiem with Gregorian chant, poetry, and other Mozart choral music. Born in Austria, Manfred Honeck completed his musical training at the University of Music in Vienna. His many years of experience as a member of the viola section in the Vienna Philharmonic and Vienna State Opera Orchestra have had a lasting influence on his work as a conductor, and his art of interpretation is rooted in a desire to venture deep beneath the surface of the music. He began his conducting career as an assistant to Claudio Abbado and as director of the Vienna Jeunesse Orchestra. Subsequently, he was engaged by the Zurich Opera House, where he was awarded the European Conducting Prize in 1993. He has since served as one of three principal conductors of the MDR Symphony Orchestra Leipzig, as Music Director of the Norwegian National Opera, Principal Guest Conductor of the Oslo Philharmonic Orchestra and Czech Philharmonic Orchestra, and Chief Conductor of the Swedish Radio Symphony Orchestra in Stockholm. In 2023, he was appointed Honorary Conductor by the Bamberg Symphony Orchestra, following decades of close collaboration. Manfred Honeck also enjoys a distinguished profile as an opera conductor. In his four seasons as General Music Director of the Staatsoper Stuttgart, he conducted premieres of operas by Berlioz, Mozart, Poulenc, Strauss, Verdi, and Wagner. He has also appeared as guest at leading houses such as Semperoper Dresden, Komische Oper Berlin, Théâtre de la Monnaie in Brussels, Royal Opera of Copenhagen, and the Salzburg Festival. In 2020, Beethoven’s anniversary year, he conducted a new staging of Fidelio (1806 version) at the Theater an der Wien. In autumn 2022, he made his much-acclaimed debut at the Metropolitan Opera in New York, leading a revival of Mozart’s Idomeneo. Beyond the podium, Manfred Honeck has created a series of symphonic suites, including Janáček’s Jenůfa, Strauss’s Elektra, Dvořák’s Rusalka as well as Puccini’s Turandot which he regularly performs around the globe. The most recent arrangement, of Strauss’s Arabella, was premiered by the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra in 2025. As a guest conductor, Manfred Honeck is a regular presence with all leading international orchestras, including Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra, Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra, Gewandhausorchester Leipzig, Staatskapelle Dresden, Tonhalle-Orchester Zürich, Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra, London Symphony Orchestra, Orchestre de Paris, Accademia di Santa Cecilia Rome and the Vienna Philharmonic. In the United States, he has conducted all major orchestras from New York to San Francisco. He has also been Artistic Director of the International Concerts Wolfegg in Germany for over three decades. In the 2025-2026 season, he will record Mahler’s Symphony No. 2 Resurrection, and Bruckner’s Symphony No. 8 with the Pittsburgh Symphony, in addition to leading a variety of American orchestral music as part of celebrations around America’s 250th anniversary. He will continue to have a strong presence in the USA, returning to the Chicago Symphony, New York Philharmonic, San Francisco Symphony and Los Angeles Philharmonic. Honouring the composer’s 200th birthday anniversay, works by Johann Strauß are at the centre of many of his concert programmes from Stockholm to Bamberg, including the jubilee concert at the Vienna Musikverein in October 2025, where he will be joined by world-famous violinist Anne-Sophie Mutter. Manfred Honeck holds honorary doctorates from several universities in the United States and was awarded the honorary title of Professor by the Austrian Federal President. In 2018, the jury of the International Classical Music Awards declared him “Artist of the Year”. Please do not shorten or revise without permission of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra. Follow"}

For a relaxing and enjoyable experience, we encourage you to arrive early, particularly if you need to stop at the box office. How do I print my tickets at home? If you selected to print your tickets at home in the purchase path, you can follow the instructions here to print them. What are your security policies? Entrance Security Policy All audience members are required to enter through state-of-the-art scanning equipment, designed both to enhance security and convenience. Heinz Hall selected a “free-flow” system which allows patrons to simply walk through unimpeded. There will be no need to remove coats or bags; cell phones and keys can remain in your pockets. Patrons using wheelchairs and mobility devices will be directed to enter via a door adjacent to the screening equipment where alternative screening will occur. Patrons with children in strollers may enter through the screening equipment. Bag and Personal Belongings Policy Heinz Hall reserves the right to search any bags entering the facility. Oversized bags must fit comfortably under a seat to ensure the safety of patrons entering or exiting seats and aisles. Bags failing to meet these requirements must be checked at which time a search will be conducted by security or returned to your vehicle. You are encouraged to leave personal computers and iPads at home, as they are required to be turned off during performances. Costume Policy Heinz Hall does not permit masks of any kind or facsimiles of weapons that would make other guests feel uncomfortable or detract from the concert experience. Guests are welcome to attend certain programs (such as, The Music of Harry Potter or The Music of Star Wars ) in costume. What exactly is the Heinz Hall “free-flow” screening system? In use at hundreds of sites worldwide including Lincoln Center, Oakland (CA) Airport and LL Bean, the Heinz Hall screening system uses “smart” technology to enhance visitor security and convenience. Heinz Hall selected a “free-flow” system which allows patrons to simply walk through unimpeded. There is no need to remove coats or bags; cell phones and keys can remain in your pockets. Patrons using wheelchairs and mobility devices will be directed to enter via a door adjacent to the screening equipment where alternative screening will occur. Patrons with children in strollers may enter through the screening equipment. Artists and promoters may require additional security procedures for their performances. What if I don't want to go through the scanner? An alternative entry door will be available that will have wanding and bag check. Is the scanner safe for medical devices and pregnant women? The system is safe to go through with medical devices and for pregnant women. However, on request, you may use the alternative entry door that will have wanding and bag check. Is screening the the same at every concert or event? As is the case now, artists and promoters may require additional security procedures for their performances. What makes the system \"smart\" and what will you do with the video images? The screening equipment uses technology to screen for threats. The images captured by the system for alarm purposes are only captured briefly; they are not retained by Heinz Hall. What should I wear to concerts? There is no official dress code for events in Heinz Hall. Many patrons wear business attire, and many prefer to be more casual. Wear whatever makes you feel more comfortable. May I bring my children? Introducing small children to music is important to the PSO and we welcome young children to our youth concerts and Fiddlesticks Family Concerts. Children, approximately age six and over, are welcome at all performances with a purchased ticket (please see Safely Together for current mask and vaccination requirements). The Latecomer's Gallery and lobby video monitors are always options for restless children. Will there be dinner service in the Mozart Room? We do not anticipate the Mozart Room reopening in the near future. Please patronize our dining partners around Heinz Hall . Do you have a pre-concert \"rush\" program? Yes.

Performance When should I applaud? Applause is usually appropriate at the end of a piece (when the conductor lowers his hands). In a multi-movement work, it is customary to wait until the end of the last movement to applaud, so as not to break the concentration of the performers. What if I have to cough? The Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra provides complimentary cough drops at the concierge desk located in the entrance lobby. May I take pictures? Unless otherwise announced in the program and at the concert, the use of still, video and digital cameras or audio recording equipment is strictly prohibited at all times in the concert hall.

{"chunk_id": "0024", "text": "Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra Close Window Time Out You have exceeded the time limit and your seats have been released. Time left to complete order Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra The two-time 2018 GRAMMY ® Award-winning Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra is credited with a rich history of engaging the world’s finest conductors and musicians and demonstrates a genuine commitment to the Pittsburgh region and its citizens. Known for its artistic excellence for more than120 years, past music directors have included Fritz Reiner (1938-1948), William Steinberg(1952-1976), André Previn (1976-1984), Lorin Maazel (1984-1996) and Mariss Jansons (1997-2004). This tradition of outstanding international music directors was continued in fall 2008,when Austrian conductor Manfred Honeck became Music Director of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra. The Pittsburgh Symphony is continually at the forefront of championing new American works. They premiered Leonard Bernstein’s Symphony No. 1 “Jeremiah”in1944, John Adams’ Short Ride in a Fast Machine in1986, and Mason Bates’ Resurrexit in 2018 to celebrate Manfred Honeck’s 60th birthday. The orchestra has a long and illustrious history in the areas of recordings and live radio broadcasts. Manfred Honeck and the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra have received multiple GRAMMY ® nominations for Best Orchestral Performance, taking home the award in 2018 for their recording of Shostakovich: Symphony No. 5; Barber: Adagio. As early as1936, the Pittsburgh Symphony has been broadcasted on the radio. Since 1982, the orchestra has received increased attention through national network radio broadcasts on Public Radio International, produced by ClassicalWQED-FM89.3, made possible by the musicians of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra. Lauded as the Pittsburgh region’s international cultural ambassador, in 2019 the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, under the leadership of Music Director Manfred Honeck, embarked on an extensive tour of Europe, the 25th in orchestra history. In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic caused the Pittsburgh Symphony to cancel the remainder of its concerts for the 2019-2020 season. Instead, the Symphony offered online concerts throughout the 2020-2021 season. The Pittsburgh Symphony celebrated its 125th anniversary with an online gala in February 2021. In summer of 2021, the Pittsburgh Symphony began to perform to a live audience outdoors, and eventually in the fall, Heinz Hall was reopened to audiences. In 2020, the Pittsburgh Symphony welcomed its second Principal Pops Conductor, Byron Stripling. A conductor, trumpet virtuoso, singer, and actor, Stripling has been a featured soloist with pops orchestras across the country. He has performed with jazz notables from the Count Basie Orchestra and the bands of Dizzy Gillespie, Dave Brubeck, Lionel Hampton, and more. Stripling’s first concert as Principal Pops conductor was an online performance in October 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. He continued to have multiple “firsts” with the symphony, performing his first in-person concert in summer of 2021 at Hartwood Acres, and his first in-person Pops concert of the season at Heinz Hall in fall of the same year."}

Directed by Henry Selick (James and the Giant Peach), the film follows the earnest-but-misguided adventures of Jack Skellington, Halloween Town’s beloved Pumpkin King. Bored with the same old scare-and-scream routine of Halloween, Jack longs to try something new. Convinced that he can spread the joy of Christmas and against the advice of Sally, a caring and clever ragdoll, Jack enlists three mischievous trick-or-treaters – Lock, Shock, and Barrel – to kidnap Santa Claus. But Jack’s merry mission puts Santa in jeopardy and creates a nightmare for good little boys and girls everywhere. The film is rated PG."}

This unforgettable night in Pittsburgh is one stop on a dynamic journey across more than 30 cities nationwide, including iconic venues like Red Rocks, the Grand Ole Opry, and a special co-bill with Diana Ross. Each night of The Big Money Tour will unfold like a multi-act musical journey connecting audiences to Batiste’s roots, his evolution, and the movement he’s building through music. Featuring selections from his critically acclaimed catalog alongside new material performed live for the first time, the show blends structure with spontaneity and becomes what he describes as “creative church”—a space for joy, openness, and collective experience. “We’re living in a complicated time, and music has this incredible ability to reframe what we’re feeling, to help us keep going,” he says. “These shows are meant to be healing, liberating, and unforgettable.” “At the heart of what I’m about is representing the cultural music I come from and taking responsibility to push it forward,” Batiste says. “That’s jazz. That’s blues. That’s soul. That’s country and gospel music—forms born from people coming together, improvising in real time, and expressing something deeper. I can’t wait to channel that energy live every night—it’s where the music hits its truest form.”"}

{"chunk_id": "0450", "text": "History Center Exhibits: Glass: Shattering Notions\nLong before being known as the Steel City, Pittsburgh was America’s Glass City. The Glass exhibition showcases the beauty, science, utility, and technology of Western Pennsylvania glass over the past 200 years.\n\nWhile the story of glass in America began at Jamestown in 1608, almost 200 years passed before skilled glassworkers crossed the Allegheny Mountains and began production in Western Pennsylvania. Since 1797, when the region’s first two glasshouses opened, the conical furnace stacks of glass factories have been a defining feature of the region’s skyline. By the Civil War, the Pittsburgh region reigned as the center of the nation’s glass industry.\n\nA generation later, Pittsburgh glass could be found everywhere — as tile for the walls of New York’s great transportation tunnels, in the searchlights on the Panama Canal, as insulators for endless miles of wire, in “Liberty lens” headlights for Ford automobiles, in beer halls and bars. Yet this region also produced glass fine enough for the White House tables of five U.S. presidents and embassies worldwide. Bottles by the boxcar load and singular presentation pieces — Pittsburgh factories made it all. Our factories lit the world with gas and electric streetlights, lamps, light bulbs, and lamp chimneys. Lenses and traffic signals brought safety to railways, roadways, and runways, while plate glass for large windows made department stores possible, allowing consumers to shop from the sidewalk. Storefronts of Carrera glass, basement windows of glass block, and skyscrapers sheathed in reflective glass — the uses for glass seemed endless.\n\nThe Pittsburgh region became not only a center for glass production but also for innovations in its manufacture, design, and marketing. Glass: Shattering Notions tells that story, unraveling the complex 200+ year history of this region’s first industry. Featuring more than 500 glass objects, immersive environments, hands-on interactives, and multimedia displays, the exhibit helps you look at, not through, the glass in your life and understand it in a new way.\n\nExhibit Must-Sees:\n- Zoo case – Glass birds, fish, animals, and more, all corralled in the zoo case.\n- Steamboat salts – Delicate pressed steamboat salts honoring Pittsburgh’s role as the Gateway to the West and a center for steamboat building.\n- Giant piece of glass cullet – A massive chunk of waste glass chipped from the furnace at L.E. Smith in Mount Pleasant, Pa., after a batch failed to melt properly.\n- Window glass video – Rare footage of Belgian blowers making cylinder window glass in Jeannette in 1905. Soon after, drawing machines replaced skilled blowers on factory floors.\n- Fry FOVAL lamp – A rare lamp made from the same glass the Fry Company of Rochester, Pa., used in its ovenware.\n- Pattern glass sugar bowl – Likely made by McKee Glass Co. of Pittsburgh around 1850, this sugar bowl showcases pressed glass panels as an advertisement for the company’s craftsmanship."}
