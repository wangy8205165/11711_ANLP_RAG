The term amusement includes admission fees paid\nto access places of entertainment, exhibition, or amusement or to a sporting event or show.\nThe term amusement specifically includes trade shows, exhibitions, builder or homes shows,\nequipment shows, craft shows, and tasting events. The term amusement does not include\nany Exempt Amusement or any amusement located outside the City limits. In the case of an\namusement that is mobile or located outdoors, an amusement is located in the City limits if\nthe event either begins or ends within the City limits.\nBy way of example, but not intended as comprehensive definition of amusement, a\nrestaurant, bar, tavern, pub, lounge, motel, or hotel is not a place of amusement if it merely\noffers incidental recorded music or TV broadcasts to patrons. A restaurant, bar, tavern, pub,\nlounge, motel, or hotel is a place of amusement if it offers entertainment such as music,\ndance, performing arts, sing-alongs, or comedy routines, or restricted sporting events not\navailable on broadcast TV, such as title boxing matches, to patrons.\nESTABLISHED PRICE - regular monetary charge of any character, including donations\nand contributions, fixed and exacted or in any manner received by Producers, as herein\ndefined, from the general public or a limited or selected number thereof, directly or\nindirectly, for the privilege of attending or engaging in any amusement, provided that;\n1.

Separately stated charges for the rental of tangible personal property, where such\ncharges reflect market pricing for such rentals, such as the rental of sports equipment\nby a Producer offering recreation, are not part of the Established Price and are not\nsubject to Amusement Tax.

The common phrases used to describe an amusement and a place of\n6\namusement change over time, but that change in common parlance does not affect the\ntaxability of the amusement. Specifically included within the term of “places of amusement”\nare: cabarets, night clubs, roof gardens, lounges, entertainment stages, music or dancing\nhalls, ball rooms, or other locations offering food or beverages or merchandise along with\nentertainment or recreation, as well as other locations that were taxable under Section 4231\nof the US Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (ignoring any exemptions or exclusions offered\nunder that federal statute) as it was in effect immediately prior to its repeal by Public Law 89-\n44 in 1965.\nPRODUCER – any person conducting any place of amusement, as herein defined,\nwhere the general public or a limited or selected number thereof, may, upon the payment of\nan established price, attend or engage in any amusement.\nRESPONSIBLE PERSON – any natural person: (i) who has check signing authority or control\nover financial accounts of the Producer; (ii) who has powers or job duties that include the\ncollection or remittance of the Amusement Tax; (iii) who has the power to make decisions\nregarding which, when, and in what order outstanding debts and taxes will be paid; and (iv)\nwho willfully fails to remit the proper Amusement Tax to the City.

If a cover is required, such charge shall be considered as the regular\nestablished price paid for admission and is taxable as such. If a total bill\nexceeds the cover charge, the total charge is taxable if it in fact represents a\ncharge for admission. If the same charge is made to the person using or\nfurnishing his own property or equipment as where property or equipment is\nfurnished by the management, such charge is an amount paid for admission\nand subject to tax. If a lesser charge is made to persons who do not desire to\nuse the property or services offered, the lesser charge represents the\nadmission charge.\n3.

Newspaper reporters, photographers, radio announcers, inspectors and\npersons of similar vocation who are admitted free to any place for the\nperformance of special duties in connection with an event and whose special\nduties are the sole reason for their presence and given free admission, are\nnot liable for any tax on admission. Free admissions granted to such persons\nwho are not admitted solely for the purpose of performing their special duties\nin connection with the event are subject to the tax equivalent to the tax\non the admission charge paid by other persons for the same or similar\naccommodations.\n12\n3. The tax imposed upon such free or reduced admissions shall be paid and\ncollected at the time such persons are admitted. In the event that tickets or\ncards of admission to the particular performance are not issued but\nadmission is secured by the presentation of a life, annual, season, weekly,\nor daily pass, the Producer shall keep a record of such admission and the\ndate upon which such privilege was exercised.\ng.

(Ord. 38-1991, eff. 11-25-91).\ng. When the City of Pittsburgh’s Amusement Tax is included in the total collections\nfrom patrons, the formula for the Amusement Tax is:\nA = Amusement Tax\n14\nA = .05 tax rate\n1.00 admission charge + .05 tax rate\nA = .05 tax rate\n1.05 admission charge + tax rate\nA = .04762\nThe Amusement Tax is deemed included in the Established Price charged the patron if the\nProducer does not separately state the Amusement Tax on any ticket or receipt as required\nby Section 303, or if no receipt or ticket is issued to the patron.\nEXAMPLE\nA = .05 tax rate X $20.00 Total\n1.00 admission charge + .05 tax rate\nA = .05 tax rate X $20.00 Total\n1.05 admission charge + tax rate\nA = .04762 X $20.00 Total\nA = $ .95\nEXAMPLE\nTotal admission charge is $20.00 x .04762 = $ .95 tax or\n$19.05 – Admission Charge\n$ .95 tax = 5% of admission charge before taxes\n$20.00 – Total (Admission Charge + Amusement Tax)\nSECTION 302 – RECORDS\nIn general each place of amusement must maintain complete and accurate records of all\ntransactions, the total amount of consideration received from all transactions and the total\namount of tax collected on the basis of such considerations. Records to be kept must\nconsist of, but are not limited to a monthly summary showing the starting and ending\nticket numbers for each series, the number of tickets sold at each representative price and\nthe amount of tax collected.\nWhere an amusement is included in the price of food and drink the place of amusement\nshall total the amount of sales, on the cash register, prior to the amusement. The place of\namusement shall begin a new cash register tape that will end when the place of\namusement ends. If the place of amusement does not do this it will pay on the 24 hour\nperiod of the day that the amusement occurred. Once the total sales have been\ncalculated from the place of amusement, the admission charge equals the amount paid for\nfood and drink times ten percent. The imputed Amusement Tax equals the admission\ncharge times five percent.\n15\nThe amount paid for food and drink x 10% = THE ADMISSION CHARGE\nThe admission charge x 5% = THE IMPUTED AMUSEMENT TAX\nRecords to be kept shall include part of each serial numbered ticket used at each place of\namusement issued to each patron and copies of all leases or contracts or agreements\nsupporting the transactions for permanent use of boxes or seats in any place of\namusement.\nSECTION 303 - TICKET LABELING\na. DELINEATING THE AMUSEMENT TAX – for each admission subject to the\ncollection of a tax pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 241, the Producer shall\ncause to be printed clearly on the face of any ticket, receipt or any other token\npurchased by a patron for the purpose of admission to an amusement the following\ninformation:\n1. The established price of admission;\n2. The amount of amusement tax due on line 1; and\n3. The sum of lines 1 and 2.\nb. SIGNS – every place of amusement must maintain, conspicuously posted at the\nentrance, and near the box-office a place at which the established price is paid,\none (1) or more signs accurately stating:\n1. The established price of admission;\n2. The amount of amusement tax due on line 1; and\n3. The sum total of the established price and the tax.\nFAILURE TO COMPLY – in the event that a Producer fails to comply with the ticketing\nand labeling provisions of Section 241.07(a) the Producer shall be subject to the\nsuspension and/or revocation of his amusement permit pursuant to section 241.03(c) of\nthe Pittsburgh Code. (Ord. 34-1994, eff. 12-30-94). The failure to comply with the ticketing\nand labeling provisions will not excuse the Producer from timely remitting the deemed\ncollected Amusement Tax.\nSECTION 304 – AMUSEMENT TAX QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS\nQ. – Are admissions to a movie theater not taxed if provided by an Institution of Purely\nPublic Charity? Is a movie theater considered a Performing Art?\nA. – No. Admissions to a movie theater are not considered a Performing Art because it is\nnot a live performance, and nor would they be considered an Exempt Performing Arts\nProduction.\nQ. – Does a Producer of home builders’ shows, trade shows, or similar exhibitions have to\ncollect the Amusement Tax?\nA. – The admission receipts from a home builders’ show are properly subject to the\nAmusement Tax. The Amusement Tax Chapter 241 of the Pittsburgh Code extends, by\n16\ndefinition to trade shows and similar exhibitions.\nQ. – Does a Producer of wine tasting, beer tasting, whisky tasting, food tasting or similar\nevents have to collect the Amusement Tax?\nA. – The admission receipts from a tasting event are properly subject to the Amusement\nTax, if the event is primarily intended to showcase a commercial product or products, even\nif no live entertainment or recreation is provided. However, if the Producer does not provide\nentertainment or recreation, but does collect sales taxes or drink taxes, based on the\nadmission charge or contribution, from the patron, then the event is an Exempt Amusement.\nA tasting event is not an Exempt Amusement even if historical or educational material is\nprovided to the patron if such historical or educational material is not the primary purpose\nof the event.\nQ. – A bar with entertainment has a cover charge of $10.00 with the Amusement Tax\nincluded. How much is the Amusement Tax?\nA. - $10.00 cover charge X .04762 = $0.48 Amusement Tax.\nQ. – A bar with entertainment has no cover charge, is any Amusement Tax owed? If so,\nhow is it calculated?\nA. – The Amusement Tax is owed. The cover charge shall be imputed per the City Code.\nThe amount paid for admission to the amusement shall be ten (10%) percent of the\namount paid for refreshment, service and merchandise. (The food and drink for a bar).\nThe place of amusement must begin a new cash register tape that will end when the\nplace of amusement ends. Once you have the total sales from the place of amusement\nyou are ready to impute the admission charge.\nThe amount paid for food and drink X 10% = the admission charge. The admission charge\nX 5% = the imputed amusement tax.\nAn imputed admission charge is implied, and the tax will be collected. An implied charge\nis one that the place of amusement would normally collect. The admission charge is\ntherefore imputed and the tax paid by the place of amusement.\n17\nARTICLE IV\nADMINISTRATION AND\nENFORCEMENT\nSECTION 401 – POWERS AND DUTIES OF TREASURER (DIRECTOR)\na. It shall be the duty of the Treasurer to collect and receive the taxes, fines, and\npenalties imposed by the City Code, Title Two, Article VII, Chapter 241. It shall also\nbe the duty of the Treasurer to keep a record showing the date of such receipt.\nb. The Treasurer is charged with the administration and enforcement of the provisions\nof the City Code, and is empowered to prescribe, adopt, promulgate and enforce\nrules and regulations relating to any matter pertaining to the administration and\nenforcement of the City Code, including provisions for the reexamination and\ncorrections of declarations and returns, and of payments alleged or found to be\nincorrect, or as to which an overpayment is claimed or found to have occurred, and\nto prescribe forms necessary for the administration of the City Code.\nc. The Treasurer is authorized to issue a ruling upon written request of a taxpayer or\nProducer.\nSECTION 402 – EXAMINATION OF BOOKS AND RECORDS OF PRODUCERS\na. Agents designated by the Treasurer are hereby authorized to examine the books,\npapers and records of any Producer or supposed Producer, in order to verify the\naccuracy of any declaration or return, or if no declaration or return was filed, to\nascertain the tax due. Every Producer or supposed Producer, is hereby directed and\nrequired to give to the Treasurer, or to any agent designated by him/her, the means,\nfacilities and opportunity for such examinations and investigations, as are hereby\nauthorized.\nb. If records are not available in the City of Pittsburgh to support the returns which were\nfiled or which should have been filed, the Producer will be required to make them\navailable to the Treasurer either by producing them in a City of Pittsburgh location or\nby paying for the expenses incurred by the Treasurer in traveling to the place where\nthe records are regularly kept.\nc. Any information gained by the Treasurer, by designated agents, or by any other\nofficial or agent of the City of Pittsburgh, as a result of any declarations, returns,\ninvestigations, hearings or verifications required or authorized by the City Code,\nshall be confidential except for official purposes and shall not be released except in\naccordance with a proper judicial order, or as otherwise provided by law.\nSECTION 403 – RECORDS TO BE KEPT BY THE PRODUCER\nProducers who collect the Amusement Tax are required to keep such records as will enable\nthe filing of true and accurate returns of the tax and such records shall be preserved for a\nperiod of not less than three (3) years from the filing date or due date whichever is later in\norder to enable the Treasurer or any agent designated by him/her to verify the correctness\n18\nof the declarations or returns filed.\nSECTION 404 – AUDITS\nIf, as a result of an examination conducted by the Treasurer, a return is found to be incorrect,\nthe Treasurer is authorized to assess and collect any underpayments of the Amusement\nTax. If no return has been filed and a tax is found to be due, the tax actually due may be\nassessed and collected with or without the formality of obtaining a return from the producer.\nDeficiency assessments (i.e., where producer has filed a return but is found to owe\nadditional tax) shall include taxes for up to three (3) years prior to the date when the\ndeficiency is assessed. Where no return was filed, there shall be no limit to the period of\nassessment.\n19\nARTICLE V\nSUITS FOR TAX COLLECTIONS, VIOLATIONS, FINES, INTEREST &\nPENALTIES\nSECTION 501 – REMEDIES NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE\nThe remedies provided in Section 502 or Section 505 are not mutually exclusive. The\nutilization by the Treasurer of one remedy does not preclude utilization of the other.\nMoreover, use of either or both of the remedies provided in these Sections does not\npreclude the use by the City of Pittsburgh of any other legal or administrative procedure\nwhich can bring about compliance by the Producer with the provisions of Chapter 241 of\nthe Pittsburgh Code and these regulations.\nOnce it has been determined that that a Producer owes a tax, the Treasurer will take all\nactions legally permitted to enforce its claim. Such action may include obtaining additional\ninformation, auditing Producer records, entering into a settlement of the disputed amount\nof the tax, or obtaining liens on the Producer’s property, wage attachments, levies, and\nseizures and sales of the taxpayer’s property in appropriate circumstances. The Treasurer\nmay enter into a written agreement with the Producer for payment of the tax in installments\nif the Treasurer believes that such an agreement will facilitate collection. The Treasurer\nmay also impose interest and applicable penalties on the tax due, and may seek criminal\ncharges in appropriate circumstances.\nSECTION 502 – SUITS FOR RECOVERY OF UNPAID TAXES\nThe Treasurer may sue in the name of the City of Pittsburgh, in law or in equity, for the\nrecovery of those taxes due and unpaid under the provisions of the Amusement Tax, to\ncompel the production of records or to enforce any other provisions of the law. Such suits\nmay also be brought against Responsible Persons.\nSECTION 503 - LIMITATIONS\na. The following periods of limitations shall apply to suits for collection of taxes.\n1. When a return has been filed but no tax paid, any suit brought to recover the tax\ndue and unpaid shall be filed within three (3) years after the return was due or\nfiled, whichever is later. Where no return was filed, there shall be no limit to file\nsuit for the collection of taxes.\n2. In the case of a deficiency assessment, suit shall be filed within three (3) years\nafter the assessment has been made.\nb. The limitations set forth in paragraph (a) shall not prevent the institution of a suit\nfor the collection of any tax due or determined to be due in the following cases:\n1. When no return was filed, there is no limitation.\n2. When the return is fraudulent, there is no limitation.\n20\n3. When there is an understatement of tax liability of twenty-five (25%) or more, and\nnot due to fraud, suit must be begun within six (6) years.\nc. A return filed before the due date is deemed to be filed on the due date.\nSECTION 504 – PENALTY AND INTEREST\na. Producers must collect the tax imposed herein and shall be liable to the City of\nPittsburgh for the payment of the tax. If, however, any Producer shall fail to make\nany report and payment as herein required a penalty at the rate of five (5%) percent\nper month for each month or a fraction of a whole month on the amount of tax and\ninterest of one (1%) percent per month for each month or fraction of a whole month\nduring the period in which the tax remains unpaid shall be added to the tax. In no\nevent shall the interest rate assessed exceed the maximum rate allowed by the\nMunicipal Claims and Tax Liens Act, 53 P.S. 7143, or applicable law.\nb. There is no limit, or cut off point, for applying penalty and interest\nc. Penalty and Interest on Deficiency Assessment.\nd. On any additional tax determined to be due as a result of a deficiency assessment,\npenalty and interest will be assessed from the day the tax should have been paid to\nthe date of payment. Penalty and interest is calculated as described above in the\napplicable portion of Section 504 (a).\ne. Where suit is brought for the recovery of such tax, the person liable therefore shall,\nin addition, be liable for the costs of collection and the interest and penalties herein\nimposed. Once due and owing, penalty and interest become part of the tax and\nshall be collected as such. A person’s belief that no tax is due and owing, or the\nfailure of any person to receive or obtain the forms required for making the returns\nrequired under the City Code is not a valid defense to the imposition of penalties\nherein for violation. Good faith shall not be a defense to the imposition of penalty.\nSECTION 505 – FINES AND PENALTIES FOR VIOLATION OF APPLICABLE\nPROVISIONS OF TITLE TWO, PITTSBURGH CODE\na. Violations – No person shall:\n1. Fail, neglect, or refuse to make any declaration or file a return required under the\nCity Code.\n2. Refuse to permit the Treasurer or his/her designee to examine the books, records\nor accounts of any business, taxable or otherwise, to determine liability.\n3. Make any incomplete, false or fraudulent return or attempt to do anything to\navoid full disclosure of the amount of tax due to avoid payment in whole or in\npart, of the Amusement Tax.\n4. Divulge information, which is confidential under Chapter 201.06 of the City Code.\n5. Fail to make any payment when it is due.\n21\nb. In addition to any other penalties or enforcement proceedings provided for by\nordinance for the collection and enforcement of taxes:\n1. Any person who willfully fails or refuses to appear before the Treasurer or his/her\nagent in person with the employer’s books, records or accounts for examination\nwhen required under the provisions of Title Two of the City Code to do so, or who\nwillfully refuses to permit inspection of the books, records or accounts of any\namusement in the person’s custody or control when the right to make such\ninspection by the Treasurer or his/her agent is requested, shall be guilty of a\nmisdemeanor and shall, upon conviction, be sentenced to pay a fine of not more\nthan five hundred dollars ($500) or to a term of imprisonment of not more than six\nmonths, or both.\n2. The fines and terms of imprisonment, imposed under this Section shall be in\naddition to any other relief granted to the City of Pittsburgh of a monetary nature\nunder the provisions of this Article.\n3. Each and every day that the violation continues shall constitute a separate offense\nfor which a fine may be imposed.\nSECTION 506 – PERSONAL LIABILITY OF RESPONSIBLE PERSONS\nBecause the Amusement Tax is collected from Patrons, the Amusement Tax is not the\nproperty of the Producer but instead is held in trust for the benefit of the City. Any\nAmusement Tax collected from patrons or deemed included in the Established Price paid\nby Patrons shall be considered trust fund taxes held for the benefit of the City. Should the\nProducer fail to timely remit the Amusement Tax due to the City, the Treasurer may assess\nand collect any unpaid Amusement Tax directly from any Responsible Person or from the\nProducer, or both. A Responsible Person can show he is not liable for any collected\nAmusement Tax if he shows the Amusement Tax has been properly refunded to the Patrons\nwho paid the tax. If the Producer uses trust fund taxes to pay a lawful obligation of the\nProducer, the payee of such funds shall not be considered a Responsible Person, unless\nthe payee acts in bad faith or has direct knowledge of the breach of trust.\nIf there are multiple Responsible Persons for a Producer, each Responsible Person shall\nhave joint and several liability for the unremitted Amusement Tax. However, in no event\nmay the Treasurer collect more from the Responsible Persons and the Producer in total\nthan the Producer owes the City.\nOnly the Amusement Tax shall be considered a trust fund asset. Penalties and interest\nassessed against the Provider, as opposed penalties and interest assessed against the\nResponsible Person directly, shall not be consider trust funds monies.\nIn an Article VI action, a Responsible Person shall not be able to challenge the Amusement\nTax calculation derived from an assessment against the Producer once that assessment\nagainst the Producer has become final.\n22\nARTICLE VI\nPRODUCER,\nTAXPAYER, AND\nRESPONSIBLE\nPERSON REMEDIES\nSECTION 601 – TREASURER (DIRECTOR) HEARINGS\nAny taxpayer, Producer, or Responsible Person aggrieved by an assessment by the\nTreasurer shall, within ninety (90) days after the date of notice of the assessment, request\na Treasurer’s Hearing on a form obtained from the Treasurer for that purpose. 53\nPa.C.S. § 8431. The Treasurer may on his/her own initiative cite a Producer or\nResponsible Person for a hearing.\na. Any taxpayer, Producer or Responsible Person who fails to request a Treasurer’s\nHearing within a timely manner, waives the right to contest any element of the\nassessment, and that party’s failure to challenge the Treasurer’s adjudication will\nbe construed as an admission by that party as to the propriety of the assessment.\nb.

Any appeal must\nbe commenced within thirty (30) days of the date of the notice of the Treasurer’s\ndecision. If no such appeal is timely filed, the aggrieved party waives his/her right to\ncontest any element of the Treasurer’s adjudication, and that party’s failure to challenge\nthe same will be construed as an admission by that party as to the propriety of the\nTreasurer’s decision. No hearing or appeal will operate to suspend the accrual of penalty\nand interest from the date the tax was due to the date it is actually paid.\nSECTION 603 – PAYMENT UNDER PROTEST\nThe Treasurer will accept payments of disputed tax amounts under protest pending\nappeals; however, any request for refund of such monies must be filed in accordance\nwith Section 604.\nSECTION 604 – REFUNDS\na.

The Producer shall\nhave sixty days to review the refund request and grant or deny the refund in writing.\nIf a patron still believes he is owed a refund, after the Producer has issued a written\nrefusal, he may file a written request for refund with the Department of Finance. Such\nwritten request shall include the name and address of the patron, the name and\naddress of the Producer, the date or dates of the amusement, a copy of any ticket or\nreceipt issued by the Producer, a short summary of the reasons why the patron\nbelieves the tax was overpaid, a copy of the written rejection from the Producer, a\ncalculation of the overpaid Amusement Tax, and a calculation of the correct\nAmusement Tax due and a calculation of the amount that should be refunded. Only\nrefund claims submitted within the timelines of Section 604(a) shall be eligible for\nrefund.\nd. No refund shall be allowed to the Producer unless the Producer provides proof to the\nDepartment of Finance that the Amusement Tax was refunded to the patron, unless\nthe Producer provides proof to the Department of Finance that no patron overpaid the\n24\ntax and the refund is due to a computational error made by the Producer in preparing\nthe return.\ne. Erroneous Refund Recovery – The Treasurer may sue for recovery of an erroneous\nrefund provided such suit is begun two years after making such refund, except that\nthe suit may be brought within five years if any part of the refund was induced by\nfraud or misrepresentation of material fact.\nSECTION 605 – INSTALLMENT PAYMENT PLAN FOR ANY DEFICIENCY\nIn the appropriate circumstances, the Treasurer will enter an installment payment plan and\ndefer further collection action, if the Producer or Responsible Person enters into a written\nagreement with the Treasurer.

To decide issues involving joint employers, the City will look to the\nguidance provided under the Fair Labor Standards Act, 29 C.F.R. § 791.2 (85 FR 2820,\neffective March 16, 2020).\nFor example, a payroll reporting company that is not a common law employer of the workers\nof another unless it is: (a) an employer of those workers under 72 P.S. § 7301(h) or (b) the\njoint employer of those workers.\nEXEMPT EMPLOYER – any person that is a Governmental Entity. A contractor or consultant,\nclassified as a Partner, a Self-employed person, or a person receiving Form 1099-MISC,\nproviding services to an Exempt Employer is not itself exempt merely because he or she\nderives service revenue from a Governmental Entity.\nGUARANTEED PAYMENTS – payments to Partners by the Partnership for services that are\ndetermined without regard to the net income of the Partnership. For example, health insurance\npremiums paid by the Partnership on behalf of any Partner are Guaranteed Payments because\nthey are determined without regard to the net income of the Partnership.\n-4-\nGOVERNMENTAL ENTITY – any agency, authority, department, or instrumentality of the\nfederal government or of another State, and any unit of government listed under 101 Pa. Code\n§ 23.221.\nINTERNAL REVENUE CODE – the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (Public Law 99- 514), as\namended, 26 U.S.C. § 1, and following, as it was in effect on January 1, 2020. Any citation to\nregulations issued under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, 26 C.F.R. § 1, and following,\nrefers to the regulations in effect on January 1, 2020.\nNET DISTRIBUTION – the amount of a Partner’s or Self-employed person’s draws from net\nincome from one or more Businesses that have activities in the City shall be reported for the\nPayroll Expense Tax. For purposes of this regulation, TAXABLE DISTRIBUTIONS are limited\nby the sum of draws or net income for that Partner or Self-employed person, whichever is less.\nIf the Partner’s or Self-Employed person’s Net Distribution exceeds that individual’s share of\nnet profits from a particular Business, the excess draw is a return of capital. A return of capital\nis not taxable because this is a liquidation of a Partner’s or Self-employed person’s assets by\nthe owner. A Partner’s Taxable Distributions shall include a partner’s share of Guaranteed\nPayments from the Partnership. Taxable Distributions shall be determined using the same tax\naccounting method used to report taxable income for Pennsylvania Personal Income Tax\npurposes, Tax Reform Code of 1971. Taxable Distributions from a Business are presumed to\nbe derived from the current year’s net income of that Business.\nPARTNER – an individual owner or member in a Partnership. A Partner will owe tax based\non Taxable Distributions. A Partner is not taxed on his or her Passive Income.\nPARTNERSHIP – an unincorporated entity, joint venture, business trust, general partnership,\nlimited partnership, limited liability company, syndicate, or any other unincorporated\nassociation, with two or more owners that is taxed for Pennsylvania state income purposes as\na pass-through entity. Tax Reform Act of 1971, 72 P.S. § 7401 (definition of a “Corporation”).\nAn unincorporated entity, with one owner, that is treated under the federal “check-the-box” as\na disregarded entity is not a Partnership. 26 C.F.R. § 301.7701-3 (as it was in effect on\nJanuary 1, 2020). See, Tax Reform Act of 1971, 72 P.S. § 7307.21. An unincorporated entity,\nwith one or more owners, that has made the federal “check-the-box” election to be taxed as a\n“corporation” is not a Partnership but it may be an Employer.\nPASSIVE INCOME – Items of income earned by a Partner or Self-employed person from\ninterest (not derived from working capital investments), dividends, capital gains (except for an\nindividual who is considered a trader and not an investor), ground rents, royalties associated\nwith the development of natural resources through a non-operating interest, retirement income\nearned after retirement, and real estate rental income where substantial services are not\nprovided to tenants, is non-taxable Passive Income. In determining whether any portion of net\nprofits from a Business may constitute Compensation or non-taxable Passive Income, the\nTreasurer will follow the guidance issued under Tax Reform Code of 1971, 72 P.S. § 7303(a),\nand the PA Personal Income Tax Return Guide, except where such guidance is inconsistent\nwith the purposes of the Payroll Tax. Income earned by a Partner or by a Self-employed\nperson, is not Passive Income if the business provides professional services (e.g. law,\naccounting, architectural, professional engineering, actuarial, or medical services) or personal\nservices to customers, unless the Partner or Self-Employed person is retired, based on age or\nyears of service, and does not provide services to the business. Guaranteed Payments made\nto a Partner are not Passive Income. Payments made to a retiring Partner under Section 736\nof the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. § 736, are Passive Income. The Passive Income\n-5-\nexclusion only applies to Partners and Self-employed persons, but not to Employees whose\nCompensation is reported to the taxing authorities on a Form W-2 or Form 1099-MISC.\nPAYROLL EXPENSE – the total Compensation paid, including salaries, wages, net\ndistributions, commissions, bonuses, stock options and other compensation to all individuals\nwho during any tax year, perform work or render services in whole or in part in the City of\nPittsburgh. Employee contributions and deductions resulting from an employee election,\nwhether deferred or otherwise, to qualified cash or deferred arrangements, such as an Internal\nRevenue Code Section 401(k) retirement plan or Internal Revenue Code Section 125\n“cafeteria plan”, do not reduce total Compensation. Compensation meeting the definition of\nearned income would be part of the Payroll Expense Tax associated with a particular\nEmployee who is not a Partner or a Self-employed person. Local Tax Enabling Act, 53 P.S. §\n6924.501 (“Earned Income”). The Payroll Tax is on gross payroll of the Employer. The\nEmployers’ portions of federal and state payroll taxes, health insurance premiums, retirement\nplan contributions, etc., are not part of taxable gross payroll.\nThe Payroll Expense of a Partner or Self-employed person is the cumulative annual Taxable\nDistributions associated with each separate Business carried on within the City rather than\n“Earned Income” as defined in 53 P.S. § 6924.501.\nPERSON – a corporation, Partnership, Partner, Self-employed individual, business trust,\nassociation, unincorporated entity, estate, trust, foundation or natural person. Whenever used\nin any provision prescribing a fine or penalty the word “person” as applied to Partnerships,\nshall mean the Partners thereof, and as applied to corporations and unincorporated\nassociations, shall mean the officers thereof. A Governmental Entity is not a Person.\nSELF-EMPLOYED – an individual who earns Compensation from one or more separate\nBusinesses carried on within the City, other than as an Employee or as a Partner. The single\nmember owner of an unincorporated entity that is treated as disregarded entity under the\nfederal “check-the-box” regulations, 26 C.F.R. § 301.7701-3 (as it was in effect on January 1,\n2020), is treated as Self-Employed and not as a Partner. The Compensation of a Self-\nemployed individual shall be that person’s Taxable Distributions from each separate business\nreported on Schedules C, E, or F of the Pennsylvania individual income tax Form PA-40, as\nwell as any other non-employee Compensation, which is not otherwise reported on Schedules\nC, E, or F. Passive Income of a Self-employed person is not subject to the Payroll Tax. If the\nSelf-Employed person does not keep records of Taxable Distributions, the entire net income\nof each separate Business is presumed to be a Taxable Distribution. Any individual who is\nclassified as an Employee, because of the control exercised by the Employer, is not Self-\nEmployed as to any Compensation associated with that particular Business.\nTAX YEAR – a twelve-month period from January 1 to December 31.\nTAXPAYER – a person, partnership, association, corporation, or other entity required\nhereunder to file a return of payroll expense, or to pay a tax thereon. An Employer, Partner, or\nSelf Employed person are a Taxpayer. An Exempt Employer is not a Taxpayer.\nTEMPORARY SEASONAL OR ITINERANT BUSINESS – shall mean an Employer whose\npresence in the City is of a duration of one hundred twenty (120) days or less.\nTREASURER – references to the Treasurer in these regulations refer to the Director and/or\nthe Department of Finance. The Director holds principal responsibility for tax administration in\nthe City of Pittsburgh. The Deputy Director of Finance serves as City Treasurer.\n-6-\nSECTION 102 – WHO MUST FILE A RETURN\na. The City Code, Title II, Article VII, Chapter 258, imposes a Payroll Tax on all persons\nthat engage, hire, employ or contract with one or more individuals, as employees, to\nperform work or render services within the City of Pittsburgh. The Payroll Tax is\ncomputed on the employer’s payroll expense. The Payroll Tax on Partners and Self-\nEmployed is computed based on Taxable Distributions from any Businesses.\nb. One hundred percent of the payroll expense is attributable to the City of Pittsburgh for\nEmployers whose employees perform work or render services exclusively in the City of\nPittsburgh.\nc. One hundred percent of a Partner’s or Self-employed person’s Taxable Distributions\nare attributable to the City of Pittsburgh for person(s) who have net income from sales\nor services rendered exclusively in the City of Pittsburgh.\nd. For employers whose employees perform work or render services partly within and\npartly outside of the City of Pittsburgh, the method of computing their payroll expense\nattributable to the City of Pittsburgh is to use the percentage of the total number of\nworking hours employed within the City of Pittsburgh compared to the total number of\nworking hours employed within and outside of the City of Pittsburgh for each individual\nemployee. Local Tax Enabling Act, 53 P.S. § 6924.303(a).\ne. Employers who have payroll expense consisting of work done within and outside of the\nboundaries of the City of Pittsburgh, but who do not regularly maintain records showing\nhours worked so as to be able to use the apportionment method under subsection (d)\nof this regulation, may use a representative test period or conduct a survey based on\nfactual data to arrive at a formula with which to calculate the percentage of payroll\nexpense attributable to the City of Pittsburgh. Any formula so established will be subject\nto review and correction by the City of Pittsburgh. A thorough description explaining the\nformula shall be attached to the first return each year. The data supporting the formula\nshall be maintained for at least three (3) years as a part of office records for audit and\nreview purposes.\nf. Partners and Self-Employed individuals who have Taxable Distributions generated from\nintrastate sales or services partly within the City of Pittsburgh or partly outside the City\nof Pittsburgh shall report on the Taxable Distributions associated with sales or services\nrendered within the City of Pittsburgh. Where it is impractical to determine the exact\nTaxable Distributions, an apportionment formula may be used. Any formula so\nestablished will be subject to review and correction by the City of Pittsburgh Finance\nDepartment. The data supporting the formula must be maintained as a part of office\nrecords for audit and review purposes. A thorough description explaining the formula\nshall be attached to the first return each year. The data supporting the formula shall be\nmaintained for at least three (3) years as a part of office records for audit and review\npurposes.\ng. Partners and Self-employed individuals who have Compensation from sources within\nand without Pennsylvania, may apportion their Compensation to the City using the\nformula used reporting personal income tax on Form PA-40, 61 Pa. Code § 109.5, by\nsubstituting the word “City” for the “Commonwealth” where necessary. In making that\ncalculation, all intrastate sales and services within Pennsylvania are deemed allocated\nto the City if the Partner’s or Self-employed individual’s sole office in Pennsylvania is\n-7-\nlocated in the City.\nh. An employer which conducts business in the City of Pittsburgh on a temporary, seasonal\nor itinerant basis shall file a return and pay the tax within ten (10) days of the completion\nof the temporary, seasonal, or itinerant business.\nARTICLE II\nIMPOSITION OF TAX\nSECTION 201 – LEVY AND RATE\nThe tax levied pursuant to the City Code, Title II, Article VII, Chapter 258 is known as the\nPayroll Tax. The rate of tax is fifty-five hundredths of a percent (.55% or .0055) of Payroll\nExpense generated as a result of an employer conducting business within the City of\nPittsburgh. Local Tax Enabling Act, 53 P.S. § 6924.303(a); Local Tax Enabling Act. 53 P.S. §\n6924.311(12).\nSECTION 202 – COMPUTATION OF TAX\na. The Payroll Tax is a tax that is levied on Employers. This tax is separate and distinct\nfrom the earned income tax withheld from employees. Under no circumstance should\nthe Payroll Tax be deducted from the employees’ compensation or benefits. Local Tax\nEnabling Act, 53 P.S. § 6924.303(f).\nb. The payroll amount apportioned to the City shall be determined as set forth in Section\n102 of the Regulations.\nc. Tax Base – The tax shall be paid quarterly and the tax for each quarter shall be\ncomputed on the Payroll Expense of the current quarter attributable to the City of\nPittsburgh. The Tax Base for Partners and Self-Employed individuals is Taxable\nDistributions associated with each separate Business within the City.\nd. An employer which conducts Business in the City of Pittsburgh on a temporary, seasonal\nor itinerant basis shall calculate the tax on the total compensation earned while in the\nCity of Pittsburgh.\ne. Discontinuing Business – Every person who ceases to carry on a Business during any\ntax quarter after having paid the Payroll Tax for the entire quarter shall, upon making\nproper application on a form obtained from the Treasurer, be entitled to receive a\nprorated refund of the tax paid based upon the period of time he was not in Business\nduring the tax quarter. In the event that a person who discontinues Business during any\ntax quarter does so before payment of the tax becomes due for such tax quarter, said\nperson may apportion the tax and pay an amount to be computed by multiplying the\nPayroll Expense for the preceding tax quarter by a fraction whose numerator shall be\nthe number of days such person was in Business during the current tax quarter and\nwhose denominator shall be the total number of days in the current quarter. The final\nreturn shall be due ten (10) days after the discontinuation of Business. Self-employed\nindividuals and Partners are considered to have discontinued their Business only if all\nseparate Businesses of the individual are discontinued.\nf. A charitable organization, as defined above, shall calculate the tax that would otherwise\nbe attributable to the City of Pittsburgh and file a return, but only shall pay the tax on\n-8-\nthat portion of its Payroll Expense attributable to business activity for which a tax may\nbe imposed pursuant to Section 511 of the Internal Revenue Code. 26 U.S.C. § 511.\nThat section imposes a federal tax on unrelated business taxable income of a charity\nthat is exempt from federal tax under Section 501(c) of the Internal Revenue Code. 26\nU.S.C. § 501(c). If the charity has purchased or is operating branches, affiliates,\nsubsidiaries or other business entities that do not independently meet the standards of\nthe “Institutions of Purely Public Charity Act”, the tax shall be paid on the payroll\nattributable to such for-profit branches, affiliates or subsidiaries, whether or not the\nemployees are leased or placed under the auspices of the charity’s umbrella or parent\norganization. Local Tax Enabling Act, 53 P.S. § 6924.303(a.1).\ng. By reason of the explicit language in the Local Tax Enabling Act, 53 P.S. §\n6924.303(a.1), Institutions of Purely Public Charity are not exempt from the Payroll Tax.\nHowever, Institutions of Purely Public Charity are exempt from Payroll Tax associated\nwith activities that are related to the charitable purposes for which the Institution was\nformed. For purposes of determining whether an activity is related to the charitable\npurposes for which the Institution was formed or unrelated under Section 511 of the\nInternal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. § 511, the Treasurer will follow federal law in effect\non January 1, 2020.\nh.

The utilization by the\nTreasurer of one remedy does not preclude utilization of the other.\nMoreover, use of either or both of the remedies provided in these Sections does not\npreclude the use by the City of Pittsburgh of any other legal or administrative procedure\nwhich can bring about compliance by the Taxpayer with the provisions of Chapter 241\nof the Pittsburgh Code and these regulations.\nOnce it has been determined that that a Taxpayer owes a tax, the Treasurer will take\nall actions legally permitted to enforce its claim.

The\npro rata share shall be determined by dividing the rate of the Local Services Tax levied for the\ncalendar year by the number of payroll periods established by the employer for the calendar\nyear. Example: $52/26 pay periods equal $2 per pay. Employers are required to remit the\nLocal Services Tax thirty days after the end of each quarter of a calendar year. For purposes of\nthis tax, sole proprietors and partners shall be deemed to be employees.\nThe situs of the Local Services Tax shall be the place of employment, but, in the event a person\nis engaged in more than one occupation or municipality at the same time, the priority of claim to\ncollect such tax shall be the municipality in which a person is principally employed for the pay\nperiods in question.\nBeginning in 2008 a person seeking to claim an exemption from the Local Services Tax may\nannually file an exemption certificate with his employer. The employee shall attach to the\nexemption certificate a copy of all the employees last pay stubs or W-2 forms from employment\nwithin the political subdivision for the year prior to the calendar year.\nExemption certificates can be downloaded at www.city.pittsburgh.pa.us/finance\nBeginning in 2008, the following persons are exempt from this tax: (1) any person whose total\nearned income and net profits from all sources within the City is less than twelve thousand\ndollars ($12,000) for the calendar year; (2) any person who served in any war or armed conflict\nin which the United States was engaged and is honorably discharged or released under honorable\ncircumstances from active service if, as a result of military service, the person is blind, paraplegic\nor a double or quadruple amputee or has a service connected disability declared by the United\nStates Veteran’s Administration or its successor to be a total one hundred percent permanent\ndisability; or ( 3 ) any person who serves as a member of a reserve component of the armed\nforces and is called to active duty at any time during the taxable year.

How is the LST deducted from the employee’s pay and remitted to the City? Example,\nemployees work full time in the City and all employees earn $12,000 or more. What is\nthe employer’s responsibility?\nANSWER: The employer is required to withhold the pro-rata share of the tax by dividing\n$52 by the number of payroll periods established by the employer for the calendar year.\nThe $52 tax would be collected at $1 per week for taxpayers paid weekly or at $4.33 per\nmonth for taxpayers paid monthly. When calculating the pro-rata share, employers are\nrequired to round down to the nearest one-hundredth of a dollar.\nThe employer must remit the LST quarterly. The LST form is provided by the City. The\ntax should be paid the month following the end of each quarter. The LST forms can be\ndownloaded at www.city.pittsburgh.pa.us/finance\n2. At the beginning of the year, an employee expects to earn a total of $10,000 in the City\nfor the entire calendar year. Should the employer withhold the LST?\nANSWER: No. If an employee files an exemption certificate with his employer stating that\nhe will earn less than $12,000 for the entire year, the employer is not required to\nwithhold the LST. The employer is required to have the exemption certificate available\nfor employees to complete.\nThe exemption certificate can be downloaded at www.city.pittsburgh.pa.us/finance\n3. A new hire files an exemption certificate with his employer. The employer and his\nemployee realize with 13 weeks left in the year that he will earn $12,000 because he is\nworking more hours than anticipated. He is paid weekly. Is his employer responsible for\nwithholding the LST now?\nANSWER: Yes. After the employer realizes that the employee will earn $12,000 or\nmore, the employer must withhold $40 ($39 + $1) from the next pay to catch-up then\n$1.00 a pay for the remaining 12 pays for a grand total of $52.\n4. Employee has two part-time jobs; one located in the City which pays him $8,000 a year\nand another in Municipality “A” that pays him $7,000 a year. Does this person need to\npay the LST?\nANSWER: No. The taxpayer should file an exemption certificate with both employers\nand have no LST deducted. The Taxpayer is not subject to the LST since he did not earn\n$12,000 in any single municipality. If the tax was withheld the employee could file a\nrefund claim with each municipality after January 31 of the following year. The refund\nrequest form can be downloaded at www.city.pittsburgh.pa.us/finance - the form is\nlisted as LST REFUND FORM.\n5. An individual works January thru June in the City and July thru December in Municipality\n“A”. He earns $10,000 a month at both jobs and is paid once a week. What is his liability\nto Pittsburgh?\nANSWER: His employer in the City should withhold $1 a week for 26 pay periods and\nremit $26 along with his other employees’ deductions to the City. Municipality “A” would\nbe entitled to the LST for the 2nd half of the year. The employee should provide proof of\nLST paid for the first half of the year to Municipality “A”.\n-6-\n6. An individual works July thru December in the City. He did not work January thru June,\nanywhere. He earns $10,000 a month. Does he owe the $52 LST to the City?\nANSWER: Yes. His employer knows that this employee is over the $12,000 low\nincome exemption level. No exemption certificate has been filed. The $52 may be\nprorated for the rest of the year; however the employer should withhold $52 because that\nis what the employee owes.\nSECOND OPTION: The employer at his option may also deduct a lump sum equal to the\nprior periods that were missed. This payroll deduction should also include the current\npayroll deduction that he and his co-workers are liable for. For example, if he is paid\nonce a week, he would add $1 to his lump sum prior liability, and this would be\ndeducted from one paycheck.\n7. An employee has 2 jobs and both are part time. Both started at the beginning of January.\nJob #1 is in the City and pays the employee $1,000 a month. Job #2 is in Municipality “A”\nand paid the taxpayer $500. Where should the tax be paid?\nANSWER: Since both jobs started at the same time, the job that pays the employee the\nmost should be considered his principal job and in this case it would be the City. The LST\nshould be paid to the City. The employee should file an exemption certificate with\nMunicipality “A” or proof that his principal employer is located in the City.\n8. On January 1, an employee worked for an employer in Municipality “A” and paid $10. In\nJune the employee started a new job in the City and will make over $12,000 at this job.\nIs the employer required to withhold the LST from the employee?\nANSWER: Yes. The employer must still withhold $42 ($52 less $ 10 previously paid)\nif the employee provides proof that the $10 was paid to Municipality “A”. Then the\nemployer must pro-rate the $42 based on the remaining payroll periods.\nSECOND OPTION: The employer at his option may also deduct a lump sum equal to the\nprior periods that were missed. This payroll deduction should also include the current\npayroll deduction that he and his co-workers are liable for. For example, if he is paid\nonce a week, he would add $1 to his lump sum prior liability, and this would be\ndeducted from one paycheck.\n9. An employee files his exemption certificate late. The employer has already withheld $52.\nCan the employee apply for a refund?\nANSWER: Yes. The employee should request the refund from the employer. It is\npermissible and recommended that his employer refund the current year LST and make\nan adjustment for their next quarterly remittance to the City for the current year.\nIf the employer does not refund the LST, the employee can apply for a refund from the\nCity after the employer’s fourth quarter payment and summary form is filed at the end of\nJanuary of the following year (see Section 301(j)).\nThe City is not required to pay interest until 75 days after the fourth quarter or when the\ntaxpayer files for a refund, whichever is later.\n-7-\n10. Employee works 4 months in the City and earns $20,000. His employer is located\noutside the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Is the employee required to pay the $52\nLST?\nANSWER: Yes.\n11. Is a self-employed person or a partner who has an office in the City or who works out\nof his home located in the City subject to the LST?\nANSWER: Yes. A self-employed person or partner is subject to the $52 LST. The\ntax may be prorated and paid quarterly.\nARTICLE III\nCOLLECTION AT SOURCE\nSECTION 301 – COLLECTION THROUGH EMPLOYERS\na. Every employer not registered with the City shall, within 15 days after first becoming an\nemployer, register with the City the employer’s name, address and such other information\nas the City may require.\nb. All employers and self-employed individuals are required to collect the Local Services Tax\nfrom all employees engaged in an occupation within the City, unless the employee files\nan Exemption certificate with the employer. Exemption certificates must indicate a basis\nfor exemption and must be retained for 3 years.\nc. Employers are required to remit the Local Services Tax within thirty (30) days after the\nend of each quarter of a calendar year. For purposes of this tax, sole proprietors and\npartners shall be deemed to be employees.\nWHEN TO FILE AND PAY – The employer shall file a return of taxes deducted for each\nthree-month period (quarter) on or before the last day of the month following each three-\nmonth period.\nFIRST QUARTER (03): January 1 thru March 31 (due April 30)\nSECOND QUARTER (06): April 1 thru June 30 (due July 31)\nTHIRD QUARTER (09): July 1 thru September 30 (due October 31)\nFOURTH QUARTER (12): October 1 thru December 31 (due January 31)\nd. Any employer, who discontinues business or ceases operation before December 31 of\nthe current tax year, shall within fifteen (15) days after discontinuing business or ceasing\noperation, file the return hereinabove required and pay the tax to the Treasurer.\ne. The failure of any employer to deduct the tax shall not relieve the employee from the duty\nto file a return and pay the tax. The employee must first contact the City of Pittsburgh\nFinance Department at 412-255-2510 then file an LS-3 form. No employer shall be held\nliable for failure to withhold the Local Services Tax to a political subdivision if the failure to\nwithhold taxes arises from incorrect information submitted by the employee as to the\nemployee’s place or places of employment. Any employer who fails to deduct the tax as\nrequired by this section, or who fails to pay the tax to the Treasurer, shall be liable for\nsuch tax in full.\n-7-\nAs to employees who present official receipts evidencing prior payment of the tax either\ndirectly or by collection through other employers in Pennsylvania, the employer shall not\ndeduct the tax but shall maintain adequate records concerning the employees.\nf. The employer must list on the employee’s pay stub how much was withheld and list the\nmunicipality it was paid to. List PITTSBURGH as “PGH”.\ng. Upfront Exemption. Employers are required to discontinue withholding the LST if an\nemployee provides an exemption certificate showing that he has earned income and/or\nnet profits of less than $12,000. The exemption certificate must verify that the employee\nreasonably expects to receive earned income and/or net profits of less than $12,000 from\nall sources within the City for the calendar year for which the exemption certificate is filed.\nA copy of the employee’s final pay stubs or W-2 forms from employment within Pittsburgh\nfor the year prior to the calendar year for which the employee is requesting an exemption\nmust be attached to the exemption certificate. Employers must make upfront exemption\nforms readily available to employees at all times and provide new employees with the\nforms at the time of hiring. Employers are relieved of liability due to incorrect information\non the exemption certificate completed by the employee.\nEmployers are only required to withhold the LST on a payroll period basis for those\npayroll periods in which the taxpayer is employed. However, when two or more employers\nemploy a taxpayer in a payroll period, an employer is not required to withhold the LST if\nthe taxpayer provides a pay stub from his/her principal employer accompanied by an\nemployee statement of principal employment that the pay stub is from the taxpayer’s\nprincipal employer and that the taxpayer will notify the employer of any change in\nemployment. Employers are relieved of liability for the tax if they fail to withhold the tax due\nto incorrect information provided by the taxpayer regarding the taxpayer’s principal\nemployer.\nh. Military Exemption. Employers must exempt from the LST: (1) members of a reserve\ncomponent of the armed forces called to active duty and (2) honorably discharged\nveterans who served in any war or armed conflict who are blind, paraplegic, or a double\nor quadruple amputee as a result of military service or who are 100% disabled from a\nservice-connected disability.\ni. Restoration of Withholding. Employers must “restart” withholding the LST from an\nemployee who files an exemption certificate in the following circumstances:\n If instructed to do so by the political subdivision levying the LST;\n If notified by the employee that he is no longer eligible for the exemption; or\n If the employer pays the employee $12,000 or more for the calendar year.\nEmployers “restart” withholding of the LST by withholding (1) a “catch-up” lump sum\nequal to the amount of tax that was not withheld from the employee as a result of the\nexemption; and (2) the same amount per payroll period that is withheld from other\nemployees.\nj. The employer must attach a summary on a CD or hard copy with the fourth quarter\npayment listing the following information:\n Employer’s name, address in Pittsburgh, Federal ID number, and the employer’s City\naccount number.\n-8-\n The summary must include an employee’s name, Social Security number, wages,\naddress and the amount of Local Service Tax withheld and paid to Pittsburgh for the\ncomplete calendar year.\n Please see the LST tax form at www.city.pittsburgh.pa.us/finance for the format to\nuse on CD.\n Concurrent Employment. If a taxpayer has two or more jobs in different political\nsubdivisions during a payroll period, the priority of claim to collect the LST is as\nfollows:\n1. Where the taxpayer maintains his principal office or is principally employed;\n2. Where the taxpayer resides and works; and\n3. Where the taxpayer is employed that is nearest in miles to the taxpayer’s home.\nk.

Any taxes deducted and withheld from employees, plus any penalties and interest\nthereon, constitute a trust fund for the benefit of the City. The failure to timely remit such funds\nallows the City to collect such trust funds from the employer, the employer’s representative, or\nany other person receiving such trust funds. 53 P.S. § 6924.705(b)(1).\nThe failure or omission of any employer to make the correct deductions required by this section\nshall not relieve any employee from the payment of the tax or the balance determined to be due,\ntogether with penalty and interest from the date the tax was due, or from complying with the\nrequirements of the Code relating to the filing of declarations and returns.\nARTICLE IV\nADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT\nSECTION 401 – POWERS AND DUTIES OF TREASURER\na.

The rate of tax is defined above and will be applied as\nfollows:\nParking Fee + Parking Tax = Total Payment\nFor example, where the tax rate is 37.5%:\n$1,000.00 + $375.00 = $1,375.00\n$1,550.00 + $581.25 = $2,131.25\n(d) Calculation of total payment where there is a surcharge. The following method\nshall be used to compute the total payment collected by the operator and paid by\nthe patron when a surcharge is imposed, whether the tax total is taken from\nindividual cash register tapes or where individual collections are not kept for each\nticket. The parking tax will be applied to the sum of the base parking fee and the\nsurcharge. The rate of tax is defined above and will be applied as follows:\n-10-\n(Base Fee + Surcharge) + Tax Rate(Base Fee + Surcharge) = Total Payment\nFor example, where the tax rate is 37.5% and the surcharge is $10:\n($1,000.00 + $10.00) + $378.75 = $1,388.75\n($1,550.00 + $10.00) + $585.00 = $2,145.00\n§ 302.
