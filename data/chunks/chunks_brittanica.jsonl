The conflict between the British and French over territorial claims in\nthe area was settled in 1758 when General John Forbes and his British and\ncolonial army expelled the French from Fort Duquesne (built 1754). Forbes\nnamed the site for the British statesman William Pitt the Elder. The British\nbuilt Fort Pitt (1761) to ensure their dominance at the source of the Ohio.\nSettlers began arriving after Native American forces led by Ottawa chief\nPontiac were defeated in 1763; an agreement subsequently was made between\nNative American groups and the Penn family, and a boundary dispute was ended\nbetween Pennsylvania and Virginia. Pittsburgh was laid out (1764) by John\nCampbell in the area around the fort (now the Golden Triangle). Following the\nAmerican Revolution, the town became an outfitting point for settlers\ntraveling westward down the Ohio River."}

A blast furnace, erected\nby George Anschutz about 1792, was the forerunner of the iron and steel\nindustry that for more than a century was the city’s economic mainstay; by\n1850 Pittsburgh was known as the “Iron City.” The Pennsylvania Canal and the\nPortage Railroad, both completed in 1834, opened vital markets for trade and\nshipping. The city suffered a great loss in 1845 when some 24 blocks of\nbusinesses, homes, churches, and other buildings were destroyed by fire."}

Growth continued nearly\nunabated through World War II, the war years bringing a particularly great\nboon for the economy. The population crested at more than 675,000 in 1950,\nafter which it steadily declined; by the end of the century, it had returned\nalmost to the 1900 level. Most citizens were still of European ancestry, but\nthe growing African American proportion of the population exceeded one-fourth.\nDuring the period of economic and population growth, Pittsburgh had come to\nepitomize the grimy, polluted industrial city. After the war, however, the\ncity undertook an extensive redevelopment program that emphasized smoke-\npollution control, flood prevention, and sewage disposal. In 1957 it became\nthe first American city to generate electricity by nuclear power."}

{"chunk_id": "00000054", "source": "https://www.britannica.com/place/Pittsburgh", "text": "By the late 1970s and early ’80s, the steel industry had virtually\ndisappeared—a result of foreign competition and decreased demand. Many of the\nsurrounding mill towns were laid to waste by unemployment, becoming a symbol\nof the notorious Rust Belt, the U.S. region where steelmaking and\nmanufacturing once thrived before succumbing to widespread unemployment and\npoverty. Pittsburgh, however, successfully diversified its economy through\nmore emphasis on light industries—though metalworking, chemicals, and plastics\nremained important—and on such high-technology industries as computer\nsoftware, industrial automation (robotics), and biomedical and environmental\ntechnologies. Numerous industrial research laboratories were established in\nthe area, and the service sector became increasingly important. Pittsburgh\nlong has been one of the nation’s largest inland ports, and it remains a\nleading transportation centre."}
