What is annual giving? Annual giving is a common description for gifts that are made during CMU's fiscal year (July 1 - June 30). They can be designated for any purpose that you choose, though some of the most common are critical needs such as student financial aid, research and the university's Carnegie Mellon Fund, which is used wherever it's most needed. If I give online, is my information secure? Carnegie Mellon University takes web security very seriously. Read more about Privacy and Web Security under our Donor Bill of Rights. Why is my annual gift important? Annual gifts are the lifeblood of the university. Since tuition only covers about two-thirds of the cost of a CMU education, annual gifts help bridge the gap. In addition, annual gifts made by undergraduate alumni help raise the alumni giving participation rate – which impacts the university’s rankings. Can I choose where my money is spent? Yes, the choice is yours! If you're giving online, just select the designation(s) that you'd like. If you're giving over the phone or via a check, just be sure to be specific about the program, school or fund you wish to support. How many consecutive years have I given? Contact us at 412-268-2582 or annual-giving@andrew.cmu.edu and we'll get you an answer straight away. What is the Carnegie Mellon Fund? The Carnegie Mellon Fund is the university’s general unrestricted fund. Gifts to this specific fund are used wherever the need is greatest. Is the Carnegie Mellon Fund the same as the Annual Fund? The short answer is no. The long answer is that the Annual Fund is actually a collection of funds, including the Carnegie Mellon Fund. If you want more detail, just give us a call at 412-268-2582 and we'll be happy to go into it in more detail. Do company matching gifts count toward donor recognition? Yes. For example, your gift of $50 matched with $50 from your company affords you recognition at the $100 level. What is the Carnegie Mellon University's Tax ID/EIN Number? 25-0969449 How much should I give? Give whatever you are comfortable giving. We really can't stress that enough. But please give every year. And remember, any amount makes an impact. I'd like to establish a scholarship. What do I do? You can create an Andrew Carnegie Society Legacy Scholarship with a gift of $10,000 (payable over four years). Or create a more permanent scholarship that will forever benefit students at CMU. Contact us at 412-268-2582 or annual-giving@andrew.cmu.edu and we'll connect you with the appropriate person. Where should I direct my gift? The choice is yours. If you have questions, please contact us at 412-268-2582 or annual-giving@andrew.cmu.edu . What is Carnegie Mellon’s fiscal year? Why is it important? CMU’s fiscal year, that is, our accounting year, runs from July 1 – June 30. We ask for and count gifts during this time frame. What is the endowment? Endowment is the permanent capital of a university. Endowment refers to assets that are invested in perpetuity, unlike expendable funds, which are typically used for immediate needs. While the endowment principal remains in tact, annually a portion of the income is made available to the university. Therefore, by building the endowment, Carnegie Mellon has a greater ability to pay for its operating expenses. A larger endowment provides the university with greater flexibility in launching new projects or initiatives as well as in providing greater support to faculty and students. A common misconception about a university’s endowment is that it is one \"pot\" of money with which the university can do what it wishes. Endowments are comprised of many separate funds, which are managed as a pool of assets. Donors set stipulations for funds and for what purpose the income may be spent. If you have further questions, contact us at 412-268-2582 or annual-giving@andrew.cmu.edu and we'll be happy to discuss the ins and outs of endowment, expendable and other fancy financial terms.

Time left to complete order Manfred Honeck Music Director Manfred Honeck has firmly established himself as one of the world’s leading conductors, renowned for his distinctive and revelatory interpretations that have garnered international acclaim. As Music Director of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, where he has now started his 18th season, he continues to shape the orchestra’s artistic identity with a deep sense of purpose and passion. His tenure, extended through the 2027–2028 season, has seen the orchestra flourish both artistically and as a cultural ambassador for the city of Pittsburgh. Celebrated at home and abroad, guest appearances under his leadership include Carnegie Hall and Lincoln Center in New York, as well as the major venues of Europe and leading festivals such as the BBC Proms, Salzburg Festival, Musikfest Berlin, Lucerne Festival, Rheingau Music Festival, and Grafenegg Festival. In summer 2024, he led the orchestra in a nine-city European Festivals Tour, beginning with their appearance as the only American orchestra at the prestigious Salzburg Festival and concluding at Vienna Konzerthaus. Manfred Honeck’s successful tenure in Pittsburgh is extensively documented by a series of recordings on the Reference Recordings label, featuring works by Beethoven, Brahms, Bruckner, Shostakovich, Strauss, Tchaikovsky, and others. They have received widespread critical acclaim and multiple GRAMMY® nominations, including a win for “Best Orchestral Performance” in 2018. In August 2025, he and the orchestra released Requiem: Mozart’s Death in Words and Music, an original concept imagining a Funeral Mass for Mozart, combining the composer’s Requiem with Gregorian chant, poetry, and other Mozart choral music. Born in Austria, Manfred Honeck completed his musical training at the University of Music in Vienna. His many years of experience as a member of the viola section in the Vienna Philharmonic and Vienna State Opera Orchestra have had a lasting influence on his work as a conductor, and his art of interpretation is rooted in a desire to venture deep beneath the surface of the music. He began his conducting career as an assistant to Claudio Abbado and as director of the Vienna Jeunesse Orchestra. Subsequently, he was engaged by the Zurich Opera House, where he was awarded the European Conducting Prize in 1993. He has since served as one of three principal conductors of the MDR Symphony Orchestra Leipzig, as Music Director of the Norwegian National Opera, Principal Guest Conductor of the Oslo Philharmonic Orchestra and Czech Philharmonic Orchestra, and Chief Conductor of the Swedish Radio Symphony Orchestra in Stockholm. In 2023, he was appointed Honorary Conductor by the Bamberg Symphony Orchestra, following decades of close collaboration. Manfred Honeck also enjoys a distinguished profile as an opera conductor. In his four seasons as General Music Director of the Staatsoper Stuttgart, he conducted premieres of operas by Berlioz, Mozart, Poulenc, Strauss, Verdi, and Wagner. He has also appeared as guest at leading houses such as Semperoper Dresden, Komische Oper Berlin, Théâtre de la Monnaie in Brussels, Royal Opera of Copenhagen, and the Salzburg Festival. In 2020, Beethoven’s anniversary year, he conducted a new staging of Fidelio (1806 version) at the Theater an der Wien. In autumn 2022, he made his much-acclaimed debut at the Metropolitan Opera in New York, leading a revival of Mozart’s Idomeneo. Beyond the podium, Manfred Honeck has created a series of symphonic suites, including Janáček’s Jenůfa, Strauss’s Elektra, Dvořák’s Rusalka as well as Puccini’s Turandot which he regularly performs around the globe. The most recent arrangement, of Strauss’s Arabella, was premiered by the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra in 2025. As a guest conductor, Manfred Honeck is a regular presence with all leading international orchestras, including Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra, Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra, Gewandhausorchester Leipzig, Staatskapelle Dresden, Tonhalle-Orchester Zürich, Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra, London Symphony Orchestra, Orchestre de Paris, Accademia di Santa Cecilia Rome and the Vienna Philharmonic. In the United States, he has conducted all major orchestras from New York to San Francisco. He has also been Artistic Director of the International Concerts Wolfegg in Germany for over three decades. In the 2025-2026 season, he will record Mahler’s Symphony No. 2 Resurrection, and Bruckner’s Symphony No. 8 with the Pittsburgh Symphony, in addition to leading a variety of American orchestral music as part of celebrations around America’s 250th anniversary. He will continue to have a strong presence in the USA, returning to the Chicago Symphony, New York Philharmonic, San Francisco Symphony and Los Angeles Philharmonic. Honouring the composer’s 200th birthday anniversay, works by Johann Strauß are at the centre of many of his concert programmes from Stockholm to Bamberg, including the jubilee concert at the Vienna Musikverein in October 2025, where he will be joined by world-famous violinist Anne-Sophie Mutter. Manfred Honeck holds honorary doctorates from several universities in the United States and was awarded the honorary title of Professor by the Austrian Federal President. In 2018, the jury of the International Classical Music Awards declared him “Artist of the Year”. Please do not shorten or revise without permission of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra. Follow"}

For a relaxing and enjoyable experience, we encourage you to arrive early, particularly if you need to stop at the box office. How do I print my tickets at home? If you selected to print your tickets at home in the purchase path, you can follow the instructions here to print them. What are your security policies? Entrance Security Policy All audience members are required to enter through state-of-the-art scanning equipment, designed both to enhance security and convenience. Heinz Hall selected a “free-flow” system which allows patrons to simply walk through unimpeded. There will be no need to remove coats or bags; cell phones and keys can remain in your pockets. Patrons using wheelchairs and mobility devices will be directed to enter via a door adjacent to the screening equipment where alternative screening will occur. Patrons with children in strollers may enter through the screening equipment. Bag and Personal Belongings Policy Heinz Hall reserves the right to search any bags entering the facility. Oversized bags must fit comfortably under a seat to ensure the safety of patrons entering or exiting seats and aisles. Bags failing to meet these requirements must be checked at which time a search will be conducted by security or returned to your vehicle. You are encouraged to leave personal computers and iPads at home, as they are required to be turned off during performances. Costume Policy Heinz Hall does not permit masks of any kind or facsimiles of weapons that would make other guests feel uncomfortable or detract from the concert experience. Guests are welcome to attend certain programs (such as, The Music of Harry Potter or The Music of Star Wars ) in costume. What exactly is the Heinz Hall “free-flow” screening system? In use at hundreds of sites worldwide including Lincoln Center, Oakland (CA) Airport and LL Bean, the Heinz Hall screening system uses “smart” technology to enhance visitor security and convenience. Heinz Hall selected a “free-flow” system which allows patrons to simply walk through unimpeded. There is no need to remove coats or bags; cell phones and keys can remain in your pockets. Patrons using wheelchairs and mobility devices will be directed to enter via a door adjacent to the screening equipment where alternative screening will occur. Patrons with children in strollers may enter through the screening equipment. Artists and promoters may require additional security procedures for their performances. What if I don't want to go through the scanner? An alternative entry door will be available that will have wanding and bag check. Is the scanner safe for medical devices and pregnant women? The system is safe to go through with medical devices and for pregnant women. However, on request, you may use the alternative entry door that will have wanding and bag check. Is screening the the same at every concert or event? As is the case now, artists and promoters may require additional security procedures for their performances. What makes the system \"smart\" and what will you do with the video images? The screening equipment uses technology to screen for threats. The images captured by the system for alarm purposes are only captured briefly; they are not retained by Heinz Hall. What should I wear to concerts? There is no official dress code for events in Heinz Hall. Many patrons wear business attire, and many prefer to be more casual. Wear whatever makes you feel more comfortable. May I bring my children? Introducing small children to music is important to the PSO and we welcome young children to our youth concerts and Fiddlesticks Family Concerts. Children, approximately age six and over, are welcome at all performances with a purchased ticket (please see Safely Together for current mask and vaccination requirements). The Latecomer's Gallery and lobby video monitors are always options for restless children. Will there be dinner service in the Mozart Room? We do not anticipate the Mozart Room reopening in the near future. Please patronize our dining partners around Heinz Hall . Do you have a pre-concert \"rush\" program? Yes.

Please note that rush pricing is subject to change. In order to guarantee seating availability, we suggest purchasing tickets prior to the day of the concert you wish to attend.

Performance When should I applaud? Applause is usually appropriate at the end of a piece (when the conductor lowers his hands). In a multi-movement work, it is customary to wait until the end of the last movement to applaud, so as not to break the concentration of the performers. What if I have to cough? The Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra provides complimentary cough drops at the concierge desk located in the entrance lobby. May I take pictures? Unless otherwise announced in the program and at the concert, the use of still, video and digital cameras or audio recording equipment is strictly prohibited at all times in the concert hall.

{"chunk_id": "1884", "text": "Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra Close Window Time Out You have exceeded the time limit and your seats have been released. Time left to complete order Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra The two-time 2018 GRAMMY ® Award-winning Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra is credited with a rich history of engaging the world’s finest conductors and musicians and demonstrates a genuine commitment to the Pittsburgh region and its citizens. Known for its artistic excellence for more than120 years, past music directors have included Fritz Reiner (1938-1948), William Steinberg(1952-1976), André Previn (1976-1984), Lorin Maazel (1984-1996) and Mariss Jansons (1997-2004). This tradition of outstanding international music directors was continued in fall 2008,when Austrian conductor Manfred Honeck became Music Director of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra. The Pittsburgh Symphony is continually at the forefront of championing new American works. They premiered Leonard Bernstein’s Symphony No. 1 “Jeremiah”in1944, John Adams’ Short Ride in a Fast Machine in1986, and Mason Bates’ Resurrexit in 2018 to celebrate Manfred Honeck’s 60th birthday. The orchestra has a long and illustrious history in the areas of recordings and live radio broadcasts. Manfred Honeck and the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra have received multiple GRAMMY ® nominations for Best Orchestral Performance, taking home the award in 2018 for their recording of Shostakovich: Symphony No. 5; Barber: Adagio. As early as1936, the Pittsburgh Symphony has been broadcasted on the radio. Since 1982, the orchestra has received increased attention through national network radio broadcasts on Public Radio International, produced by ClassicalWQED-FM89.3, made possible by the musicians of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra. Lauded as the Pittsburgh region’s international cultural ambassador, in 2019 the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, under the leadership of Music Director Manfred Honeck, embarked on an extensive tour of Europe, the 25th in orchestra history. In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic caused the Pittsburgh Symphony to cancel the remainder of its concerts for the 2019-2020 season. Instead, the Symphony offered online concerts throughout the 2020-2021 season. The Pittsburgh Symphony celebrated its 125th anniversary with an online gala in February 2021. In summer of 2021, the Pittsburgh Symphony began to perform to a live audience outdoors, and eventually in the fall, Heinz Hall was reopened to audiences. In 2020, the Pittsburgh Symphony welcomed its second Principal Pops Conductor, Byron Stripling. A conductor, trumpet virtuoso, singer, and actor, Stripling has been a featured soloist with pops orchestras across the country. He has performed with jazz notables from the Count Basie Orchestra and the bands of Dizzy Gillespie, Dave Brubeck, Lionel Hampton, and more. Stripling’s first concert as Principal Pops conductor was an online performance in October 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. He continued to have multiple “firsts” with the symphony, performing his first in-person concert in summer of 2021 at Hartwood Acres, and his first in-person Pops concert of the season at Heinz Hall in fall of the same year."}

Bored with the same old scare-and-scream routine of Halloween, Jack longs to try something new. Convinced that he can spread the joy of Christmas and against the advice of Sally, a caring and clever ragdoll, Jack enlists three mischievous trick-or-treaters – Lock, Shock, and Barrel – to kidnap Santa Claus. But Jack’s merry mission puts Santa in jeopardy and creates a nightmare for good little boys and girls everywhere. The film is rated PG."}

Each night of The Big Money Tour will unfold like a multi-act musical journey connecting audiences to Batiste’s roots, his evolution, and the movement he’s building through music. Featuring selections from his critically acclaimed catalog alongside new material performed live for the first time, the show blends structure with spontaneity and becomes what he describes as “creative church”—a space for joy, openness, and collective experience. “We’re living in a complicated time, and music has this incredible ability to reframe what we’re feeling, to help us keep going,” he says. “These shows are meant to be healing, liberating, and unforgettable.” “At the heart of what I’m about is representing the cultural music I come from and taking responsibility to push it forward,” Batiste says. “That’s jazz. That’s blues. That’s soul. That’s country and gospel music—forms born from people coming together, improvising in real time, and expressing something deeper. I can’t wait to channel that energy live every night—it’s where the music hits its truest form.”"}

{"chunk_id": "2113", "text": "Since its invention in 1904, the Banana Split has become an iconic part of American dessert culture. Its history began when David Strickler, a 23-year-old “soda jerk” at a drugstore in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, started experimenting with different ice cream combinations. He cut a banana lengthwise, added three scoops of ice cream – typically vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry – and initially topped it with sweet syrups, chopped nuts, whipped cream, and a maraschino cherry. It was an instant hit!\nThe Banana Split quickly gained popularity, particularly among the students at nearby St. Vincent College, who would frequent the drugstore to indulge in the delicious dessert. Strickler’s banana-based sundaes quickly became known as “Dr. Dave’s” among the students, who would rave about them to their hometown soda jerks, spreading the word about the new dessert.\nWithin a few years, the Banana Split gained national recognition. The dessert had become a staple of American dessert culture, and Strickler had become a pioneer of the ice cream industry.\nStrickler went on to buy the Latrobe pharmacy where he had invented the Banana Split, and he even added an optical business upstairs. He was a staple in the local community until he passed away in 1971 at the age of 90.\nIn 2004, on the 100th anniversary of the Banana Split, “Ice-Cream Joe” Greubel worked with the University of Pitt to commemorate Strickler’s invention with the “From Pitt Came the Split” Event.\nThe Great American Banana Split Celebration has been a staple in Latrobe since 2013, when the Pennsylvania Historical Society unveiled a marker at the former site of Tassel’s Pharmacy where Sticker was working at the time of his invention, cementing Strickler’s legacy in historical record.\nToday, the Banana Split remains a beloved dessert across the United States and is often found on the menus of ice cream shops and restaurants. It is also the official dessert of Pennsylvania!\nHonorary Chair\nIce Cream Joe Greubel\nThe legacy of Latrobe as the birthplace of the banana split might not have been fully realized had it not been for the efforts of Ice Cream Joe. While locals knew of the town’s claim to the dessert, it was Joe who in 2004, on the 100th anniversary of the invention, worked with the University of Pittsburgh on the “From Pitt Came the Split” event. He was also part of the group of Latrobeans that submitted the petition for the Pennsylvania Historical Marker that was installed in 2013.\nFrom 2015 until his passing in 2017, Joe served up ice cream, ideas, and smiles as the celebration’s honorary chair."}

{"chunk_id": "2424", "text": "History Center Exhibits: Glass: Shattering Notions\nLong before being known as the Steel City, Pittsburgh was America’s Glass City. The Glass exhibition showcases the beauty, science, utility, and technology of Western Pennsylvania glass over the past 200 years.\n\nWhile the story of glass in America began at Jamestown in 1608, almost 200 years passed before skilled glassworkers crossed the Allegheny Mountains and began production in Western Pennsylvania. Since 1797, when the region’s first two glasshouses opened, the conical furnace stacks of glass factories have been a defining feature of the region’s skyline. By the Civil War, the Pittsburgh region reigned as the center of the nation’s glass industry.\n\nA generation later, Pittsburgh glass could be found everywhere — as tile for the walls of New York’s great transportation tunnels, in the searchlights on the Panama Canal, as insulators for endless miles of wire, in “Liberty lens” headlights for Ford automobiles, in beer halls and bars. Yet this region also produced glass fine enough for the White House tables of five U.S. presidents and embassies worldwide. Bottles by the boxcar load and singular presentation pieces — Pittsburgh factories made it all. Our factories lit the world with gas and electric streetlights, lamps, light bulbs, and lamp chimneys. Lenses and traffic signals brought safety to railways, roadways, and runways, while plate glass for large windows made department stores possible, allowing consumers to shop from the sidewalk. Storefronts of Carrera glass, basement windows of glass block, and skyscrapers sheathed in reflective glass — the uses for glass seemed endless.\n\nThe Pittsburgh region became not only a center for glass production but also for innovations in its manufacture, design, and marketing. Glass: Shattering Notions tells that story, unraveling the complex 200+ year history of this region’s first industry. Featuring more than 500 glass objects, immersive environments, hands-on interactives, and multimedia displays, the exhibit helps you look at, not through, the glass in your life and understand it in a new way.\n\nExhibit Must-Sees:\n- Zoo case – Glass birds, fish, animals, and more, all corralled in the zoo case.\n- Steamboat salts – Delicate pressed steamboat salts honoring Pittsburgh’s role as the Gateway to the West and a center for steamboat building.\n- Giant piece of glass cullet – A massive chunk of waste glass chipped from the furnace at L.E. Smith in Mount Pleasant, Pa., after a batch failed to melt properly.\n- Window glass video – Rare footage of Belgian blowers making cylinder window glass in Jeannette in 1905. Soon after, drawing machines replaced skilled blowers on factory floors.\n- Fry FOVAL lamp – A rare lamp made from the same glass the Fry Company of Rochester, Pa., used in its ovenware.\n- Pattern glass sugar bowl – Likely made by McKee Glass Co. of Pittsburgh around 1850, this sugar bowl showcases pressed glass panels as an advertisement for the company’s craftsmanship."}

The event has grown through the years and now lasts four days. Sal Richetti, who was born and raised in Bloomfield has produced the event since 2012. Sal grew up in Bloomfield, attended Immaculate Conception grade school and Central Catholic High School. He is a local musician who has been performing for over 30 years in the tri-state area, and is the owner of Big Day Entertainment, located in the Strip District, since 1995. He is no stranger to the festival, having booked the entertainment in previous years. In 2013 he expanded it to four days. Previously, the event was always held in September, since 2013 it has moved to August. I wanted to give vendors more opportunity with the longer daylight, additionally; there is less chance of cold weather I am excited and honored to produce this community-oriented event in the community where I was born and raised. I want to be able to produce Little Italy Days so the businesses can benefit from the large crowds and everyone else including residents, organizations, schools and churches can become involved. Sponsors of Little Italy Days include Official Sponsors - Highmark & Allegheny Health Network, Stage Sponsor - Rohrich Shadyside Honda.

You can also read about Louis Bierbauer and how the Pirates got their current nickname and see hand drawn illustrations of Pirate greats.\n\nOther Items on the Club Level include:\nThrough the corridors connecting these three spaces, impactful selections from local artists Tom Mosser, Dino Guarino, and Cody Sabol are showcased prominently.

{"chunk_id": "3867", "text": "The Ballpark\nPNC Park, which opened in spring 2001, is a classic-style ballpark, an intimate facility that embraces the progressiveness of Pittsburgh while saluting the spirit of early ballpark originals such as Forbes Field, Wrigley Field and Fenway Park. It is the fifth home of the Pittsburgh Pirates since their inception in 1887.\n\nThis riverfront facility combines the best features of yesterday's ballparks - rhythmic archways, steel trusswork and a natural grass playing field - with the latest in fan and player amenities and comfort.\n\nLocation\nPNC Park's prime location along the shore of the Allegheny River and adjacent to Federal Street takes advantage of scenic vistas of the downtown skyline and riverfront, as well as pedestrian and riverboat access, creating an exciting and dramatic urban sports venue. It also provides easy access for pedestrians crossing the Roberto Clemente Bridge from downtown, as well as those arriving from the riverwalk. On game days, the bridge is closed off to vehicular traffic and spectators are met by a dynamic interactive retail/restaurant and sports pavilion beyond right field, with attractions for all ages.\n\nDesign\nThe facility was designed by Hellmuth, Obata and Kassabaum (HOK), Inc. out of Kansas City, MO. The design and construction management team consisted of a joint venture between Pittsburgh-based Dick Corporation and Barton Malow with offices in Baltimore, MD. The Architect of Record was L.D. Astorino & Associates of Pittsburgh.\nPNC Park is the first ballpark with a two-deck design to be built in the United States since Milwaukee's County Stadium was completed in 1953. Because of its intimate design, the highest seat is just 88 feet from the field, giving every fan in the park an ideal sight line.\nPNC Park is approachable and pedestrian in scale. Designed to fit within the existing city grid, it is also orientated to allow a great majority of spectators a spectacular view of the Clemente Bridge and the downtown skyline beyond.\nThe home of the Pirates is instantly recognizable as a ballpark, with architectural flourishes of Forbes Field lending a touch of nostalgia. The series of masonry archways extending along the entry level facade and decorative terra cotta tiled pilasters exude the charm of the club's former home of 61 years.\n\nFeatures\nAmong the features of the beautiful facility are 69 suites with their own concourse level, club seating at both the field and mezzanine levels with their own respective lounges, an outfield barbecue run by former Pirate Manny Sanguillen, an outdoor river terrace and river walk. PNC Park also features the Left Field Lounge & Jim Beam Porch, offering a casual dining and sports bar atmosphere with wait service before, during and after every game for all ticket holders. The ballpark houses retail areas along the Federal Street and General Robinson Street corridor, including Slice on Broadway, the Pirates Clubhouse Store, PNC Bank and the Pirates administrative and ticket offices.\n\nPlaying Field\nThe irregularly shaped, natural grass playing field measures 325 feet down the left foul line and 389 feet through the left field power alley. The park reaches its greatest distance of 410 feet at a nook located just left of center field. The distance down the right field foul line is 320 feet, 375 feet down the power alley, and 399 feet to center field. The outfield wall rises up to 21 feet behind right field (in honor of the Pirates legendary right fielder #21, Roberto Clemente) and drops down to just six feet in front of the left field bleachers. From home plate to the Allegheny River is 443 feet, 4 inches.\n\nThe Pirates and the Park\nPerhaps the strongest inspiration for PNC Park's design is the legacy of the Pirates themselves. Few cities can boast of a 115-year relationship with the same Major League ballclub. Pittsburgh deserves nothing less than a ballpark classic that will enthrall fans for generations to come."}

After 18 years at Exposition, including hosting the first World Series in 1903, the Bucs moved to Forbes Field in Oakland on June 30, 1909.

{"chunk_id": "3887", "text": "The Terrible Towel Legend - Visit Pittsburgh\nHistory of the Terrible Towel\nDiscover the history of The Terrible Towel of the Pittsburgh Steelers which began with Myron Cope and lives on today.\nThe History of the Luckiest Towel in Sports\nThe Terrible Towel was created by the late Myron Cope, the Pittsburgh Steelers broadcaster who needed a way to excite the team's fans during a 1975 playoff football game against the Baltimore Colts. Cope urged fans to take yellow dish towels to the game and wave them throughout. The stands were filled that day and the Steelers always seemed to complete terrific plays when the towels were waving. The Steelers won, 28-10. The team moved on in the playoffs and for Super Bowl X in January 1976, the Steelers introduced gold towels with the words \"Myron Cope's Terrible Towel\" printed in black. The Steelers went on to beat the Dallas Cowboys, 21-17, many claiming, \"thanks to the Towel.\"\nIn 1996 Mr. Cope gave the rights to \"Myron Cope's Official Terrible Towel\" to the Allegheny Valley School in the Pittsburgh suburb of Coraopolis. The school provides care for more than 900 children, adults and senior citizens with mental retardation and physical disabilities. Proceeds from the Terrible Towel have helped raise almost $1.1 million for the school. On Jan. 15, 2005, during the Steelers playoff run at Acrisure Stadium, VisitPittsburgh sponsored the \"World's Largest Terrible Towel Wave,\" reaching millions of Steelers fans around the world, known amongst themselves as \"Steelers Nation.\" The team came back from what appeared to be a sure loss against the New York Jets, winning the game in overtime, 20-17. It appeared that the Towel had done it again.\nThe Steelers went on to host another home game the following week, Jan. 23, 2005, vs. the Patriots. Another massive Terrible Towel Wave was organized but this time the Steelers lost, 41-27. The victors that day went on to win Super Bowl XXXIX in Jacksonville. But the Steelers didn't give up on the Terrible Towel. On Halloween, Oct. 31, 2005, a special Terrible Towel was created to honor the retired Cope for his 35 years as a Steelers broadcaster and was waved prior to the Monday Night Football game between the Steelers and the Baltimore Ravens at Heinz Field (now named Acrisure Stadium). A limited edition of 35,000 were made, all with familiar \"Cope-isms\" like \"Yoi!\" By the way, that night, the Steelers won, 20-19.\nFor Super Bowl XL, played on Feb. 5, 2006 in Detroit, a special edition Terrible Towel was created for fans around Steelers Nation to help the team to victory. It worked! The Steelers beat the Seattle Seahawks, 21-10. Sadly, Myron passed away on Feb. 27, 2008 but his legend lives on. For Super Bowl XLIII, Feb. 1, 2009 in Tampa, another towel was produced to mark the occasion. The outcome? Steelers over Arizona, 27-23, to give them an unprecedented six Super Bowl Championships.\nOn Sunday, Jan. 23, 2011, the Steelers not only beat the New York Jets in the AFC Championship to advance to their third Super Bowl in six years, the game was played on what would have been Myron's 82nd birthday. Somehow that just seems so right. Those who knew and loved Myron, friends and fans alike, know he’s somewhere smiling and cheering, \"Here We Go Steelers, Here We Go!\"\nThe Terrible Towels will be out in force Christmas weekend 2022. The Immaculate Reception, the greatest play in NFL history, fittingly celebrates its (black and) golden 50th anniversary with festivities reuniting Steelers legends from that era during a rematch against the Raiders at Acisure Stadium on Dec. 24, 2022."}

The Steelers are the **fifth-oldest team** in the National Football League.\n\nAt their founding, the Steelers joined the NFL’s **Eastern Division** as one of only 10 teams in the league. Of those original teams, only five still remain today: the **Steelers**, **Chicago (Arizona) Cardinals**, **Green Bay Packers**, **Chicago Bears**, and **New York Giants**.\n\nFrom humble beginnings to greatness, the Steelers have grown into one of the league’s most successful franchises. Today, they are **tied for the most Super Bowl titles (6)** and boast **27 members of the Pro Football Hall of Fame**, including **Bill Cowher**, **Troy Polamalu**, and **Donnie Shell**, who were part of the **Class of 2020** enshrined in 2021.\n\n### 90 Years of This & That\n- **Super Bowl Bling:** The Steelers’ six Super Bowl victories — **IX, X, XIII, XIV, XL,** and **XLIII** — are marked by increasingly elaborate championship rings, symbols of the team’s enduring dominance.\n- **Love the Look:** Over 90 years, the Steelers’ uniform has evolved from the simple 1933 original into one of the most iconic designs in all of sports. Fans proudly identify with the black and gold that defines Pittsburgh.\n- **Squad Goals:** Team photos have captured generations of players united in pride and purpose. From the early years to today, every player wearing the Steelers jersey represents a piece of a proud, unbroken legacy.\n\nFrom **Art Rooney’s vision** to **90 years of championship tradition**, the Pittsburgh Steelers’ story continues to stand as a symbol of perseverance, pride, and excellence in professional football."}
{"chunk_id": "3896", "text": "The History of the Steelers Logo\n\nWhen it comes to key dates in Steelers history, none is more important than **July 8, 1933**, when **Art Rooney Sr.** founded the franchise. For its first seven years, the team was called the **Pittsburgh Pirates**, but before the **1940 season**, Rooney renamed it the **Steelers** to honor the city’s steel heritage.\n\nTo commemorate the new name, Rooney received a plaque featuring a football-shaped design surrounded by the words *“Pittsburgh Steelers Football Club.”* While NFL logos didn’t exist at that time, Rooney liked the design, and it became the team’s first logo—used primarily as letterhead.\n\nIn the **late 1950s**, as the NFL began expanding its fan base, **Dan Rooney** encouraged the team to develop a public-facing logo. This led to the creation of the **“Man on the Beam”** design, symbolizing the city’s steelworkers. The logo gained recognition through newspapers and reappeared in **1998** when the NFL launched its throwback merchandise program.\n\nBy **1962**, the Steelers made a historic change. **Republic Steel**, based in Cleveland, offered the franchise the **Steelmark** logo—a design created by the **American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI)**. The Steelmark features a circular emblem with three colored **hypocycloids** (yellow, orange, and blue) and the word *“Steel.”* Each color represents a key element in steel production:\n- **Yellow** – Coal\n- **Orange (later red)** – Iron ore\n- **Blue** – Steel scrap\n\nInitially, the Steelers placed the Steelmark logo on only one side of their **gold helmets** as a test. When the 1962 season ended successfully (9-5 record and a Playoff Bowl appearance), Rooney decided to switch to **black helmets**, finding that the logo stood out better. \n\nThe team then received permission from the AISI to replace the word *“Steel”* with *“Steelers,”* and the orange hypocycloid was changed to red. This version of the **Steelers logo**, introduced in **1962**, remains **unchanged to this day**—a lasting tribute to Pittsburgh’s steel industry and the team’s enduring identity."}

Passed down through generations or gifted to newborn fans, the Terrible Towel has become an essential part of Steelers culture.\n\nThe idea originated in **1975** when former Steelers radio announcer **Myron Cope** created it during the playoffs to rally fans. The towel quickly became a good luck charm as the Steelers went on to win **Super Bowl X** over the Dallas Cowboys. From that moment, the Terrible Towel became a staple of Pittsburgh football and one of the most recognized fan symbols in sports.\n\nSince its creation, the Terrible Towel has appeared everywhere—from **Three Rivers Stadium** to **Heinz Field** (now Acrisure Stadium)—and beyond.
