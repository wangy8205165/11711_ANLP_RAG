The\nMayor and City Controller are elected through a citywide vote. City Council’s nine representatives are elected to\noffice by residents in each of their respective districts.\nThe Office of the City Controller is responsible for auditing all City expenditures, in order to prevent wasteful or\nfraudulent practices. Additionally, the City Controller reviews and approves contracts and is also charged with\nreporting to the citizens of Pittsburgh, the Mayor, and City Council the state of the City’s fiscal condition. Every\nyear, the City Controller issues the Annual Comprehensive Financial Report, which provides detailed information\non Pittsburgh’s short-term and long-term financial outlook.\nCity Council proposes, deliberates, and votes on legislation governing and/or affecting the City. This body also\napproves appointments, regulates revenues and expenditures, and approves the final Operating and Capital\nBudgets. City Council is responsible for the introduction of legislation generated by the administrative branch of\nCity government and may also introduce legislation from individual Council members to the body as a whole.\nThe Office of the City Clerk, is the centralized staff support to Council, under the direction of the City Clerk. The\nCity Clerk, with the help of the Records Management Division, serves as a centralized document and information\nresource to Council, all City Departments, and the residents of the City of Pittsburgh. The City Council Budget\nDivision monitors City finances and conducts independent analyses of City operations. It prepares and distributes\nto Council, periodic reports on revenues, expenditures, and other trends relating to the fiscal condition of the City\nof Pittsburgh. It supervises and reviews City Council's annual operating and capital budgets and compiles special\nreports and executive summaries to assist Members in their deliberations.\nThe Office of the Mayor is the largest branch of the government of the City of Pittsburgh and is directly\nresponsible for much of the City’s daily operations. This work is performed by individual Departments, Offices,\nBureaus, and Commissions. The services provided by these entities range from public safety and public works to\ndebt management. Many of these departments focus on specific services. For example, the Department of Law\nacts as a legal advisor to the Mayor, City Council, and other Departments. Two units act as umbrella\norganizations. The Department of Public Safety Bureau of Administration oversees the Bureaus of Police, Fire,\nEmergency Medical Services, and Animal Care and Control, as well as the Office of Community Health and\nSafety. Similarly, the Department of Public Works Bureau of Administration oversees the Bureaus of Operations,\nEnvironmental Services, and Facilities.\nAdditionally, there are seven governmental units which fall within the Office of the Mayor in the City’s managerial\nhierarchy but whose sources of financing exist outside of the City’s General Fund. For this reason, these\nAuthorities are not included in the Operating Budget.\nA comprehensive visualization of the government of the City of Pittsburgh is included in the organization chart\npresented in this document.\n18\nCity of Pittsburgh Operating Budget\nFiscal Year 2025 Budget Guide\nWhat is the Operating Budget?\nThe Operating Budget functions as the financial plan for the current fiscal year. Reported within this document are\nfigures related to planned expenditures and projected revenues for the upcoming fiscal year. Expenditures are\nspread across all City Departments, Bureaus, and Elected Offices. These expenditures represent costs for the\nadministration and distribution of governmental services. These services include, but are not limited to: public\nsafety, refuse collection, snow removal, street paving, the issuance of permits and licenses, and maintenance and\nprogramming for local parks and community recreation centers. In addition, the General Fund also supports the\nroutine administration of local government that includes employee wages and health benefits, workers’\ncompensation benefits, utility and fuel usage, the funding of municipal pension plans, and debt service.\nThe City collects revenues to finance the costs associated with delivering services to residents. Revenues are\ncollected by the City from the levy of taxes, collection of fees related to the issuance of permits and licenses,\ncharges for services provided by City Departments, fines and forfeitures, intergovernmental revenues, and other\nrevenue generating mechanisms.\nThe Operating Budget combines information relating to expenditures and revenues, creating a plan as to what\ngovernmental services can be executed by the City and subsequently delivered to the public within a given fiscal\nyear. The detailed financial figures within this document illustrate both the cost incurred by the City of Pittsburgh in\ndelivering services to the public and the means through which these costs are financed.\nThe Operating Budget also stands as a policy document outlining the strategic initiatives of both the Mayor and\nMembers of City Council. Laws established by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania restrict how much money the\nCity of Pittsburgh may raise through the levy of taxes and charges for permits and licenses. As a result, the City of\nPittsburgh must balance the demands for services against the available resources that it can legally acquire\nthrough tax and non-tax revenue generating mechanisms. Given the reality of scarce resources, the City must\nprioritize initiatives and fund only those determined to be most essential and beneficial to the overall health of the\nCity. The level of funding allocated to individual Departments and programs within the City clearly exhibits\npriorities set by the City’s elected public officials.\nFinally, the Operating Budget can be viewed as a legally binding document. All of the costs incurred by the City of\nPittsburgh in providing day-to-day public services must be paid for out of the Operating Budget. Therefore, the\nCity of Pittsburgh must act within the confines of the financial details outlined within this document. The Operating\nBudget can only be altered through a series of formal processes, which parallel those enacted in the initial\ncreation of the plan.\nBasis of Accounting\nThe General Fund budget is adopted on a cash basis of accounting, meaning that the City of Pittsburgh\nrecognizes revenues when they are received and expenditures when they are paid.\nThe Fiscal Year\nThe City of Pittsburgh’s fiscal year begins on the first day of January and ends on the last day of December of\neach year. This can only be changed by ordinance.\nBalanced Budget Mandate\nThe City’s Home Rule Charter requires that the annual Operating Budget be balanced, with estimated revenues\nequal to or greater than estimated expenditures. Should revenues exceed expenditures at the end of a fiscal year,\nthe budget surplus is transferred into the City’s reserve fund balance.\n19\nCity of Pittsburgh Operating Budget\nFiscal Year 2025 Budget Guide\nThe City’s Fund Structure\nIn accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the City’s financial reporting system is organized on\na fund basis consisting of two major types of funds: governmental and fiduciary.\nGovernmental Funds\nGeneral Fund\nCapital Projects Fund\nCommunity Development Funds\nSpecial Revenues Funds\nFiduciary Funds\nPension Trust Fund\nAgency Funds\nThe General Fund is the main operating fund for the City. It includes most tax revenues and is used to sustain\nmost of the City’s day-to-day activities, including public safety, public works, parks, planning, and general\nadministration.\nThe Capital Projects Fund is used to fund construction and/or maintenance of any public property, facility, or\nprogram (such as buildings, park facilities, infrastructure, information technology systems) that is expected to\nprovide a long-term benefit to the City. All projects funded by debt should meet two requirements: a minimum\nvalue of $50,000 and a life expectancy greater than five years. Funding for the Capital Projects Fund comes from\nthree major sources: Pay-As-You-Go (PAYGO) funding, bonds, and State and Federal Funds. For more detail on\nthe Capital Budget and what it funds, please refer to the 2025 Capital Budget document.\nCommunity Development Funds are funded primarily by the federal Department of Housing and Urban\nDevelopment (HUD). These funds are earmarked for projects relating to housing, economic development, and\nhuman services needs in neighborhoods with a high concentration of low- to moderate-income households.\nSpecial Revenue Funds are funds in which a substantial portion of the proceeds or inflows are restricted or\ncommitted for a specific purpose. Examples of these include the Liquid Fuels Fund, the Pittsburgh Partnership\nFund, and the Grants Fund. While they are included in this document, the City only sets formal appropriations for\ntwo of the funds: the Stop the Violence Fund, and the Parks Tax Fund. Although many of these include the word\n“trust” in their titles, this is more of an informal recognition that the funds are designated for special purposes; the\nfunds are not held by any trustees or custodians.\nFiduciary Funds are used to account for resources held for the benefit of parties outside the government. These\nresources are not available to support the City of Pittsburgh’s own operations and are custodial in nature. The\nCity’s pension plans and its agency funds fall under this type of fund.\n• The City administers three pensions for full time employees: one for police officers, a second for\nfirefighters, and a third for municipal employees.\n• Agency funds include accounts held for employee benefits, payroll withholding, escheats, and tax\nrefunds. The Workers Compensation VEBA (Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Account), the OPEB (Other\nPost-Employment Benefits) Trust Fund, and Real Estate Tax Refunds Trust Funds are examples of\nFiduciary Funds.\nBudget Allocations\nThis budget document divides total expenditures across the Elected Offices, Departments, and Bureaus that\ncomprise the government of the City. Individual divisions carry out unique tasks.\n20\nCity of Pittsburgh Operating Budget\nFiscal Year 2025 Budget Guide\nThe City utilizes a hierarchical chart of accounts to distribute funds to each Department, Bureau, Agency, and\nElected Office. These accounts are organized by levels of detail, with the individual object accounts being the\nmost specific:\nFund ... Cost Center ... Subclass ... Object Account\nThe legal appropriations in the Operating Budget refer to the General Fund, which is coded as 11101. Costs are\nnext delineated by distributing funds across the City’s divisions, referred to here as cost centers.\nCity Offices, Departments, and Bureaus (Cost Centers)\n106000 Office of the City Controller\n101100 City Council Districts\n101200 Office of the City Clerk\n102000 Office of the Mayor\n102200 Office of Management and Budget\n103000 Department of Innovation and Performance\n105000 Commission on Human Relations\n107000 Department of Finance\n108000 Department of Law\n108100 Ethics Hearing Board\n240000 Office of Municipal Investigations\n109000 Department of Human Resources and Civil Service\n110000 Department of City Planning\n130000 Department of Permits, Licenses, and Inspections\n210000 Department of Public Safety – Bureau of Administration\n220000 Bureau of Emergency Medical Services\n230000 Bureau of Police\n250000 Bureau of Fire\n280000 Bureau of Animal Care and Control\n102300 Office of Community Health and Safety\n410000 Department of Public Works – Bureau of Administration\n420000 Bureau of Operations\n430000 Bureau of Environmental Services\n450000 Bureau of Facilities\n500000 Department of Parks and Recreation\n600000 Department of Mobility and Infrastructure\n999900 Citizen Police Review Board\nCosts are next directly assigned to a subclass, which is a general expenditures category. These include personnel\ncosts and costs incurred as a result of general operations.\nSubclasses\n51 Personnel - Salaries and Wages\n52 Personnel - Employment Benefits\n53 Professional and Technical Services\n54 Property Services\n55 Other Services\n56 Supplies\n57 Property\n58 Miscellaneous\n82 Debt Service\n90 Transfers\n91 Transfers - Out\n21\nCity of Pittsburgh Operating Budget\nFiscal Year 2025 Budget Guide\nThe chart of accounts delineates these subclasses into further detail called object accounts. Object accounts are\nthe most detailed level to which the City of Pittsburgh budgets.\nExpenditures are both budgeted and recorded using the account string depicted below. The account string begins\nby identifying the fund, followed by the cost center (City division), subclass (expenditure category), object account\n(expenditure category detail), and fiscal year. Below is an example account string that represents expenditures\nrelated to postage for the Department of Finance.\n11101.107000.56.56105.2025\n11101 107000 56 56105 2025\nGeneral Dept. of Supplies Postage Fiscal\nFund Finance Year\nWhat Are the City's Sources of Revenues?\nAnnual City of Pittsburgh revenue is generated by both tax and non-tax sources. There are seven subclasses.\nRevenues\n41 Tax Revenue\n42 License and Permit Revenue\n43 Charges for Services\n44 Fines and Forfeitures\n45 Intergovernmental Revenue\n46 Interest Earnings\n47 Miscellaneous Revenues\nTax Revenue\nTaxes comprise the majority of City of Pittsburgh revenues. In addition to wage and property taxes, there are\nmany that are generated by the wide range of services, institutions, and entertainment available within the City.\nThey are collected from both residents of the City of Pittsburgh as well as nonresidents, when appropriate.\nReal estate taxes are the single largest source of tax revenue. The City collects them on behalf of the City, School\nDistrict, and the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh. Real estate taxes are levied on land and buildings located within\nthe City of Pittsburgh. Assessments are conducted at the county level by the Allegheny County Office of Property\nAssessments and the tax is collected based on the fair market value of property. As of 2024, the City real estate\ntax rate is 8.06 mills, the School District real estate tax rate is 10.25 mills, and the Carnegie Library real estate tax\nrate is 0.25 mills. Tax relief is provided through various programs including the Homestead Exemption (Allegheny\nCounty Act 50 of 1998) and Senior Tax Relief (Allegheny County Act 77 of 2000).\nOther sources of tax revenue for the City of Pittsburgh are the Earned Income Tax, the Payroll Preparation Tax,\nthe Parking Tax, the Local Service Tax, the Amusement Tax and Non-Resident Sports Facility Usage Fee, the\nDeed Transfer Tax, the Public Service Privilege Tax, and the Institution and Service Privilege Tax.\nEarned Income Tax is a conventional 3 percent wage tax applied to City and School District residents who earn\nwages, salaries, tips, bonuses, or other net profits in a given year. City residents pay a 1 percent City tax and a 2\npercent School District tax. Interest, dividends, active duty pay from the Armed Forces, pensions, social security,\nand capital gains are commonly excluded.\nThe Payroll Preparation Tax was initiated following the City of Pittsburgh’s entry into Act 47 in 2003 and is levied\nat the rate of 0.55 percent on the gross payroll of employers and the distribution of net income from self-employed\nindividuals, members of partnerships, associations, joint ventures or other entities who perform work or provide\nservices within the City of Pittsburgh. Nonprofit and other charitable organizations are excluded from this tax.\n22\nCity of Pittsburgh Operating Budget\nFiscal Year 2025 Budget Guide\nFinally, the Parking Tax is collected from users of private and public parking facilities located within the City of\nPittsburgh. A portion of the Parking Tax is dedicated to the City of Pittsburgh’s pension fund until 2051.\nIn 2023, actual tax revenue totaled $513,723,794, or 78.1 percent of total City revenue.\nCity of Pittsburgh voters approved a referendum in 2019 to add 0.50 mills to the real estate tax to collect funds for\nthe improvement of the City's parks. These funds are not deposited into the General Fund. Please see the Parks\nTax Trust Fund section for more information.\nNon-tax Revenue\n“Non-tax revenue” is a catch-all term referring to funding mechanisms utilized by the City of Pittsburgh that do not\ndirectly involve the levying of taxes. Residents may be familiar with examples such as building construction\npermits and liquor and malt beverage licenses. However, there are other types of non-tax revenue, such as\ninterest earnings on investments, that are less visible. Generally, the two largest subclasses of non-tax revenue\nfor the City of Pittsburgh come from intergovernmental sources and license and permit fees.\nEach year, the City of Pittsburgh receives funding from federal, state, and local government sources in the form of\ngrants, aid, and reimbursements for services performed. For example, the Liquid Fuels Tax object account\nconsists of funds received from the state and offsets some of the costs of road maintenance and road salt. Most\nintergovernmental funding comes from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in the form of pension aid. Local\nentities, such as the Pittsburgh Parking Authority and the Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority, and federal\nagencies also contribute to intergovernmental revenue. In utilizing this funding, the City's goal is to enhance the\nquality of municipal services and reduce the City's financial burden.\nMany City departments provide various services for which rent or fees are charged. Examples of these fees\ninclude payments for safety inspections, copying City documents, rents from City properties, and the use or sale\nof rights of way. In addition, the City is compensated for services provided to other municipalities and\ngovernmental entities. For example, Emergency Medical Services collects fees after it transports individuals to\nreceive medical care.\nIn 2023, actual non-tax revenue totaled $144,223,023, or 21.9 percent of total City revenue.\nHow Does the City Spend Money?\nThe tax and non-tax revenue collected annually by the City of Pittsburgh is used to provide services to residents\nranging from refuse pick-up to the regular maintenance of capital assets. Expenditures are monitored by\ndepartment or division and by subclass.\nMajor expenditures include health insurance costs, pension payments, and workers’ compensation claims for City\nof Pittsburgh employees. The Operating Budget also pays the principal and interest costs associated with past\nand current issuance of debt generated by previous and ongoing capital projects and other programs. The chart\nbelow illustrates historic costs associated with debt service, pension and other post-employment benefits (OPEB)\ncontributions, health insurance and workers’ compensation.\n23\n)snoilliM(\n$\nCity of Pittsburgh Operating Budget\nFiscal Year 2025 Budget Guide\nSelect Major Expenditures, 2019-2023\n150,000,000\n100,000,000\n50,000,000\n0\nHealt W h I o n r s k u e r r a s n ' C ce o mpe P ns e a n t s io io n n and OPEB Debt Service\n2019 2020 2021\n2022 2023\nHealth Insurance\nThese expenditures are categorized within the Personnel – Employment Benefits subclass.

Debt service exists as its own subclass within the Department of\nFinance and is composed of the following accounts:\nDebt Service\n82101 Interest Expense - Bonds\n82103 Principal\nBudget Creation Process\nThe operating budget development cycle begins in late spring, when the Office of Management and Budget\n(OMB) forwards a memorandum detailing the budget preparation process and general high level expectations,\npolicy goals, and citywide strategic initiatives to all City divisions. OMB also holds public meetings, as required by\nCity Code.\nAfter receiving baseline budgets from OMB, individual divisions work with their budget analysts to draft and submit\nproposals. Each division presents budget proposals to OMB. These proposals include current year achievements,\nrequests for general and project-specific funding, and personnel position changes. The Mayor reviews the\nproposals to ensure that requests align with citywide goals and strategic plans/initiatives and decides which, if\nany, should be funded.\nThe Mayor releases a preliminary budget at the end of September. OMB hosts additional public meetings to\ngarner feedback. If fiscal conditions allow for changes, revisions are made. When the proposals and the Mayor’s\nstrategic initiatives are aligned, the Mayor formally submits both budgets to City Council in November.\nCity Council reviews the budget and holds a number of meetings and televised hearings with each division. After\nconsideration of public input and Member priorities, City Council makes changes to the budget and then holds a\nvote to adopt the budget. This must occur before December 31st. Failure to enact a budget prior to January 1st of\nthe new year means that the City cannot pay any vendors, cannot undertake any projects, and cannot (subject to\ncollective bargaining agreements) pay any employees. The last time a budget was not approved before\nDecember 31st was 1931.\nUpon adoption, OMB is responsible for implementing and overseeing the City of Pittsburgh’s Operating and\nCapital Budgets. Throughout the fiscal year, OMB monitors the City’s expenditures and revenues, provides\nlegislative oversight on any matters related to the budget, and oversees budget transfers and adjustments.\nAnalysts in OMB prepare quarterly reports on the performance of major revenue sources and expenditure\ncategories, reports on key factors driving the budget, reports on cash flow, and brief updates on important\nmanagement initiatives.\n25\nCity of Pittsburgh Operating Budget\nFiscal Year 2025 Budget Guide\nFive-Year Financial Forecast\nIn addition to developing the budget, OMB and the Department of Finance are responsible for estimating both\nexpenditures and revenues for the four years following the next fiscal year. Together, these estimates comprise\nthe five-year financial forecast reported in the budget document.\nThe five-year forecast allows City Officials to evaluate the fiscal health of the City for a longer period of time. This\naids in identifying any future trends related to revenues and/or expenditures that may have an immediate or long-\nterm impact on City operations. In addition, the five-year plan is used by City decision makers when planning for\nlong-term strategies, formulating departmental and citywide initiatives, and developing new policies that might\nresult in a financial impact. The financial forecast is an essential tool in maintaining financial discipline, thus\nensuring the delivery of essential services to residents of the City of Pittsburgh.\nRevenue Forecast\nRevenues represent the available resources afforded to the City to carry out basic administrative operations and\ndeliver services to City residents. The ability of the City of Pittsburgh to generate revenue is governed by the\nrights afforded to the City under its Home Rule Charter and by the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.\nProjected future year expenditures are directly influenced by future year revenues projections.\nThe Department of Finance utilizes a variety of techniques and information sources to develop revenue forecasts.\nPrevious years’ financial data is used to forecast growth for major tax and non-tax revenues. Monthly and end-of-\nyear financial data related to all revenues are archived and updated in the City’s enterprise resource planning\n(ERP) system. This information is then analyzed through statistical methods to ascertain growth in each revenue\nline. Where applicable, the City then applies a growth rate to each revenue line.\nIn addition to the previous years’ financial data, the City consults with S&P Global to forecast regional economic\nvariables. These economic variables help to inform how various aspects of the economy can affect revenue\ngenerating activity in the City. The City also incorporates data from federal government agencies such as the\nBureau of Economic Analysis and the Bureau of Labor Statistics and organizations such as Fannie Mae, the\nNational Association of Realtors, and RealSTATs.\nRevenue projections are finalized after a series of meetings with various stakeholders related to the City of\nPittsburgh’s Operating Budget. The City Controller verifies that budgetary assumptions and estimates are\ndeveloped in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards and that revenue assumptions are\nreasonable. Following consensus by all stakeholders in the budget development process, the revenue projections\nare finalized and incorporated into the five-year financial forecast.\nExpenditure Forecast\nOMB is responsible for developing the expenditure projections for the five-year forecast. To develop these\nforecasts OMB first enters all known future year expenditures into its budget management software. These known\nexpenditures are those that are either contractual (professional service contracts, debt service payments, pension\ncontributions, etc.) or generally predictable (staffing levels in each department, citywide salary increases, etc.).\nOMB then develops forecasts which consider past year expenditure data and future growth, strategies, and\ninitiatives. While most costs remain relatively static some expenditures lines, such as healthcare and fuel, are\nsubject to growth in future years. These increases are largely a product of costs rising in the private market. This\nis accounted for in the financial forecast by applying a percentage growth each year based on trend,\nLastly, the Directors of each City division present any requests that are not captured by the methods described\nabove. These requests are often related to software, equipment, or personnel and are regarded to be essential in\nachieving the goals or augmenting the services of each individual Department. OMB compiles all such requests\nand evaluates how they relate to the Mayor’s strategic initiatives. Subject to available funds, those requests that\nfall in line with the citywide initiatives are funded in each respective division’s budget in the five-year forecast.\n26\nCity of Pittsburgh Operating Budget\nFiscal Year 2025 Budget Guide\nHow to Read the Budget\nThroughout this budget document, financial data is illustrated in a variety of ways. In general, each separate\nsection of the document reports the same financial data. The level of detail is the only substantial difference\nbetween each report within a section.\nDepartmental Sections\nThe most detailed and specific illustration of the General Fund Operating Budget financial data can be found in\nthe Departmental Sections of the document. This section details funds by subclass and account that have been\nappropriated to each individual division. The following are the different components that in aggregate make up the\nDepartmental Sections of the Operating Budget.\n27\nCity of Pittsburgh Operating Budget\nFiscal Year 2025 Budget Guide\nOrganization Chart\nThe organization chart is a visual depiction of the functional areas within each City Department, Agency, Bureau,\nor Elected Office that are responsible for the execution of services and programs. The chart is very general; with\nthe exception of directors or other managers, the chart does not identify individual positions.\nDepartmental Overview\nAt the beginning of each departmental section, readers will find a Mission Statement which defines the\norganization. The Mission Statement is followed by an overview that provides a detailed description of the\ndepartment. This section of the narrative describes different functional areas within each Department, Agency,\nBureau, or Elected Office and their associated services or programs. Current year accomplishments are listed.\nPosition Summary\nThe position summary lists all of the budgeted jobs within the organization. The full-time equivalent, or “FTE,”\nrepresents the number of full-time workers in the position. The “Rate/Grade” category indicates how an\nemployee’s pay level is calculated. Grade and step plans for non-union employees and AFSCME 2719 employees\ncan be found as an appendix to this document. For full time positions, a “12” in the “Hours/Months” column\nindicates that the position is budgeted for all 12 months in the year. Smaller numbers indicate a position starting or\nending mid-year. For part time positions, the number in this column represents budgeted hours of work. The\n“Budget” column highlights the total amount, in dollars, that is allocated to pay all personnel in that position. The\n“Vacancy Allowance” adjusts the subclass expenditures to account for savings associated with vacant positions\nthroughout the year. A summary from 2024 is also included to facilitate comparisons.\nSubclass Detail\nThis portion of the departmental budget includes 2023 actual expenditures and budget numbers at the subclass\nand object account level. For example, the general “Professional and Technical Services” subclass will highlight\nthe appropriation amounts for specific accounts, such as “Administrative Fees,” “Workforce Training,” and\n“Computer Maintenance.” Readers can easily compare budgeted expenditures from 2024 with budgeted\nexpenditures for 2025. The final columns shows the difference and percent difference between the 2024 and 2025\nbudgeted amounts.\nUnder the Personnel – Salaries & Wages subclass, there are several important details. Regular salary represents\nthe total base pay for the organization. Longevity pay is awarded to employees in certain collective bargaining\nagreements based on seniority and tenure. Salary allowances are used to pay for part-time, temporary, or\nseasonal workers, as well as student interns. When uniform allowances are paid directly to employees, their costs\nare listed accordingly. Leave Buyback represents sick leave hours that can be “sold back” to the City. Premium\nPay appropriations compensate for overtime hours. Reimbursements are funds from outside sources that are\nused to offset certain position expenses.\nFive-Year Forecasts\nFinally, the five-year forecast allows readers to consider what the City expects to spend in the future. In addition to\nthe 2025 budget, there are projections for 2026 through 2029. The percent change from the prior year is included\nas a reference point.\nNote for Fund Accounts\nFor special revenue accounts that are included in the Operating Budget, the Fiscal Year 2025 summary is\ncomposed of the “Projected Beginning Balance” for January 1, 2025, anticipated revenues and expenditures, and\nthe “Projected Ending Balance” for December 31, 2025. These funds carry over from year to year. A position\nsummary follows when appropriate.\n28\nFive-Year\nFinancial Forecast\n29\nCity of Pittsburgh Operating Budget\nFiscal Year 2025 Five-Year Financial Forecast\nTarget Budget\n2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029\nEstimate Budget Forecast Forecast Forecast Forecast\nREVENUES\nReal Estate Tax $ 145,141,754 $ 143,853,454 $ 142,093,706 $ 141,546,700 $ 140,545,544 $ 139,450,889\nEarned Income Tax 136,891,520 145,043,285 150,990,059 156,727,681 162,526,605 168,215,035\nPayroll Preparation Tax 75,660,456 77,256,346 78,955,985 80,693,017 82,306,877 83,953,015\nParking Tax 53,212,650 53,627,771 55,581,123 57,609,383 59,594,838 62,681,192\nRegional Asset District Tax Relief 25,622,995 27,335,349 28,034,560 28,762,765 29,528,725 30,230,059\nDeed Transfer Tax 47,175,747 42,340,589 43,022,590 43,715,576 43,715,576 43,715,576\nAmusement Tax 20,942,569 19,476,329 20,009,313 20,513,504 21,023,927 21,511,917\nLocal Service Tax 14,529,756 13,303,663 13,183,930 13,065,275 12,947,687 12,831,158\nFacility Usage Fee 2,256,301 6,091,912 6,232,026 6,375,363 6,521,996 6,672,002\nTelecommunications Licensing Tax 1,290,216 1,260,249 1,272,851 1,285,580 1,298,435 1,311,420\nInstitution Service Privilege Tax (130,998) 158,748 155,187 152,161 149,195 149,195\nNon-Profit Payment for Services 589,248 598,839 612,613 624,865 637,362 650,109\nOther Taxes — — — — — —\nLicenses and Permits 19,451,071 17,537,948 17,937,363 18,292,686 18,655,081 19,024,744\nCharges for Services 38,058,771 42,770,460 43,455,350 44,072,357 44,708,759 45,343,744\nFines and Forfeitures 8,975,657 9,308,494 9,522,589 9,713,182 9,907,446 10,105,595\nIntergovernmental Revenue 42,448,891 53,755,298 54,279,549 54,769,811 54,778,811 54,788,811\nInterest Earnings 20,402,496 14,878,061 14,729,280 14,581,988 14,436,168 14,291,806\nMiscellaneous Revenues 47,431,067 238,361 243,718 248,484 253,345 258,303\nTotal Revenues $ 699,950,167 $ 668,835,156 $ 680,311,793 $ 692,750,376 $ 703,536,378 $ 715,184,571\nEXPENDITURES\nSalaries $ 286,946,531 $ 291,117,797 $ 296,349,787 $ 304,688,745 $ 316,052,483 $ 324,568,484\nHealth Benefits 66,008,371 61,747,534 65,976,981 76,653,419 80,508,358 84,546,790\nWorkers' Comp. 16,747,676 13,626,904 13,675,200 13,700,314 13,719,498 13,719,498\nPension & OPEB 112,868,340 112,473,417 113,477,253 114,533,732 115,787,139 116,836,980\nOperating Departments 137,040,440 112,704,123 111,179,104 113,857,023 113,170,510 114,746,642\nDebt Service 62,349,072 73,949,315 78,614,912 47,776,521 52,893,214 57,762,174\nTotal Expenditures $ 681,960,430 $ 665,619,090 $ 679,273,238 $ 671,209,755 $ 692,131,202 $ 712,180,567\nOPERATING RESULT $ 17,989,737 $ 3,216,065 $ 1,038,555 $ 21,540,621 $ 11,405,176 $ 3,004,004\nBEGINNING RESERVE FUND\nBALANCE $ 208,473,429 $ 177,957,800 $ 145,969,691 $ 119,349,129 $ 113,225,663 $ 96,961,638\nTransfer to PAYGO (22,578,036) (12,704,175) (5,159,117) (5,164,087) (5,169,200) (5,174,466)\nTransfer to Early Childhood\nCommunity Facilities Fund (214,482) — — — — —\nTransfer to Housing\nOpportunity Fund (10,000,000) (10,000,000) (10,000,000) (10,000,000) (10,000,000) (10,000,000)\nTransfer for Housing Issuance (2,500,000) (2,500,000) (2,500,000) (2,500,000) (2,500,000) (2,500,000)\nTransfer to Stop the Violence Fund (9,852,848) (10,000,000) (10,000,000) (10,000,000) (10,000,000) (10,000,000)\nTransfer to Tech.

The forecasts are based on economic assumptions, recent collection trends, and\ncurrent laws and policies. However, actual revenues could vary from forecasts due to unforeseeable economic\nand technical factors.\n2025 Operating Budget Revenue\nRevenues are divided into tax and non-tax revenues. In 2025, tax revenues are budgeted at approximately $530.3\nmillion and non-tax revenues are budgeted at $138.5 million, comprising approximately 79.3 percent and 20.7\npercent of total revenues, respectively.

On average, residential\nproperty comprises approximately 55 percent of the total assessed value of property in the City of Pittsburgh and\nnon-residential property comprises approximately 45 percent. Prior to the county-wide reassessment effective in\n2013, the total assessed value of property in the City grew by approximately 1.2 percent on average per year\nsince 2003. The county-wide reassessment led to appeals, most notably for non-residential property, and the total\nassessed value decreased by 7.8 percent in 2014. Until 2024, Since then, the total assessed value of property\ngrew by about 1.6 percent on average per year. In 2024, the total assessed value decreased by 4.7 percent.\nThe largest taxpayer incentives that reduce current year real estate tax liability are the homestead exemption, the\nAllegheny County Act 77 of 2000 property tax relief (for senior citizens who meet certain requirements), and the 2\npercent early-filer discount. Non-profits are exempt from this tax. Real estate tax incentives for future years are\nestimated as an average percentage of tax liability based on data since the reassessment.

The City plans to achieve these by:\n• Eliminating operating deficits in the baseline financial projections while preserving core municipal services\n• Managing the City’s debt burden to provide more resources to support daily operations\n• Keeping the City’s fund balance at an appropriate level to avoid the need for cash flow borrowings and\nprovide an adequate buffer against unanticipated revenue shortfalls or expenditure increases\n• Maintaining the City’s pension fund contributions at levels recommended by its actuary\nThe 2025 Operating Budget and Five-Year Plan provides a fiscally responsible path to address legacy costs and\nimprove the City’s long-term fiscal health by:\n• Allocating an additional $282 million to the pension fund over five years beyond the state mandated\nminimum municipal obligation (MMO) to reach the actuarial recommended contribution (ARC)\n• Continuing efforts of responsible borrowing with the City’s debt burden totaling 11.1 percent of General\nFund expenditures in 2025\n• Allocating a $12.7 million in \"pay-as-you-go\" (PAYGO) transfer to the capital improvement plan\nIn addition to the information outlined in the revenue and expenditure sections of the budget document, key\ncomponents and assumptions incorporated into the forecast include the following:\n• Salaries & Wages: OMB will continue to work with departments to identify opportunities to increase\nworkplace productivity and implement other operational efficiencies as part of the enterprise cost\nmanagement initiative.\n• Employee Benefits: This category includes all health care costs for both active and retired employees,\nworkers' compensation costs, employer mandated costs such as social security, and employer\ncontributions to the pension fund. Health care costs are projected to rise over the course of the next few\nyears, but the City is working to improve its overall wellness program with the goal of improving employee\n52\nCity of Pittsburgh Operating Budget\nFiscal Year 2025 Expenditures\nhealth and managing costs. Pension projections incorporate initiatives related to increased pension\nfunding and the 2018 increase in the parking tax commitment.\n• Other Non-Personnel Operating Costs: Projections for this category incorporate contractually required\ncosts that are known at this time, analyses of historical spending, and the reallocation of budgets across\neach department.\n• Debt Service: The forecast compares known debt service schedules with estimates for anticipated future\nissuances to determine debt service. This helps practitioners decide whether the City will be able to\nresponsibly issue bonds to address the City’s critical infrastructure needs.\n• PAYGO: The City funds a number of capital projects through a transfer from the General Fund into the\nCapital Projects Fund each year. PAYGO (or “pay-as-you-go”) transfers are funds that the City spends on\ncapital projects that may not be eligible for bond or Community Development funds. In the 2025 Capital\nImprovement Plan, projects funded with PAYGO are mainly focused on neighborhood improvement,\neconomic development, and blight remediation. The forecast assumes that the City will continue to\ncontribute PAYGO funds for capital projects consistent with Chapter 218 of the City Code, contributing\n$12.704175 million in 2025 and a total of $20.7 million from 2026 to 2029.\nMost non-personnel related subclasses are projected to remain relatively flat or increase modestly throughout\nfiscal year 2029. Debt Service will decrease significantly in 2027.\n2025-2029 Spending by Subclass\n$800,000,000\n$600,000,000\n51 Personnel-Salaries & Wages\n52 Personnel-Employee Benefits\n53 Professional & Technical Services\n54 Property Services\n55 Other Services\n$400,000,000\n56 Supplies\n57 Property\n58 Miscellaneous\n82 Debt Service\n$200,000,000\n$0\n2025 2026 2027 2028 2029\nThe 2025 Operating Budget and Five-Year Plan achieves substantial improvements in terms of the percentage of\ntotal expenditures related to debt service. In fiscal year 2015 expenditures related to debt service reached\n$89,289,167. This represented 18.6 percent of total budgeted expenditures. In the 2025 Operating Budget, total\nplanned expenditures related to debt service is $73,949,315, or 11.1 percent of total budgeted expenditures. This\ntrend illustrates the City’s commitment to long term financial health. The long term impact of this plan will allow the\nCity to responsibly borrow at more favorable rates, comply with the City’s debt policy, and provide resources to\ninvest in the City’s assets.\n53\nCity of Pittsburgh Operating Budget\nFiscal Year 2025 Expenditures\nDebt Service\n20.0%\n$600,000,000\n$400,000,000\n10.0%\n$200,000,000\n$0 0.0%\n2018 ( 2 a 0 c 1 tu 9 a ( 2 l a ) 0 c 2 tu 0 a ( 2 l a ) 0 c 2 tu 1 a ( 2 l a ) 0 c 2 tu 2 a ( 2 l a ) 0 c 2 tu 3 a ( 2 l a ) 0 c 2 2 tu 4 0 a 2 ( l 5 a ) c ( 2 t p u 0 r a 2 o l 6 j ) e c ( 2 p t 0 e r 2 o d 7 j ) e c ( 2 p t 0 e r 2 o d 8 j ) e c ( 2 p t 0 e r 2 o d 9 j ) e c (p te ro d j ) ected)\nBudget Total Debt Service\nPercent of Total Expenditures\n54\nCity of Pittsburgh Operating Budget\nFiscal Year 2025 Expenditures\nExpenditure Account Summary\nAccount 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029\n51 -

For each team, EMS provides an administrative and leadership role as well\nas a cadre of highly qualified personnel and instructors.\nFor River Rescue, EMS provides two Paramedic Public Safety SCUBA divers to staff the units. The Bureau of\nPolice assigns an officer/helmsman who provides a law enforcement component to the units. This unit conducts\nport security and safety patrols on a routine basis.\nFor the SWAT Team, EMS provides trained Tactical EMS (TEMS) personnel who have undergone all of the\nrequired SWAT training in addition to specialized treatment under fire training.

Our mission is to serve marginalized\ncommunities that have been systematically isolated from society and victimized by an unjust system. Through the\ntireless work of our frontline workers, public safety liaisons, and subject matter experts we aim to address the\nneeds of those living in poverty, experiencing homelessness or housing instability, substance use disorder, and\nmental or behavioral health challenges.\nDepartmental/Bureau Overview\nThe Office of Community Health and Safety is focused on building a response continuum and developing\nsustainable upstream interventions to address unmet community social service needs that often fall to Public\nSafety personnel, who represent the 24/7 safety net response. Through partnerships and program development,\nthe Office will focus on:\nContinuum of Support (COS)\nThrough continued collaboration with first responders and community members, analysis of calls for service,\nmapping of existing services, development of new partnerships, and evaluation of existing models, the Office of\nCommunity Health & Safety (OCHS) will improve upon the existing continuum of resources and responses to\naddress community unmet social service needs that are often encountered by Public Safety partners. First\nresponder social support referrals, case conferencing and review, and service gap analysis will be utilized to\nenhance this continuum. Co-Response, People In Need of Support (PINS), and the Trauma Survivor’s Assistance\nProgram (TSAP) constitute the Continuum of Support and additional information regarding each of those\nprograms is directly below.\nCo-Response\nThe Co-Response program has been developed to provide the “right responders” to individuals who are\nexperiencing a mental health or behavioral crisis. Teams consist of a Community Social Worker and dedicated\nPittsburgh Bureau of Police officer who are dispatched to co-respond to individuals in crisis. Through trust-building\nand the provision of services, Co-Response seeks to reduce the propensity for individuals who experience mental\nand behavioral health crises to engage in violent behavior and become involved in the criminal justice system.\nThrough the reduction in use of force, the program also aims to increase both the officer and community\nmember’s safety. This will be supported by training Co-Response Officers on Crisis Response Intervention\nTraining (CRIT), a national best-practice model rolled out by the Department of Justice.\nPeople In Need of Support\nThe PINS program developed as a partnership between the three Public Safety Bureaus and the Office of\nCommunity Health & Safety. First responders identify and refer City residents who frequently utilize 9-1-1 services\nto meet their basic needs, as well as individuals who may be vulnerable to harm and need follow up. Community\nSocial Workers and Public Safety liaisons conduct home visits to assess the health and social needs of these\nresidents and develop a plan to link the residents to services and resources (including CIT and FBI cases). High\nutilizers also known as \"frequent flyers\" who disproportionately utilize 9-1-1 services place strain upon the\nemergency response system. By connecting these individuals to long-term services and supports, we relieve\npressure on the systems in place to assist people who experience crises. Nationally, these programs are known to\nprovide systems-level cost-savings.\nTrauma Survivors Assistance Program\nThe Trauma Survivors Assistance Program (TSAP) is a partnership between the Office of Community Health &\nSafety (OCHS) and the three Bureaus of Public Safety. TSAP social workers engage with victims of crime and\nsurvivors of trauma to provide emotional support and link them to appropriate trauma and crisis response services\nto stabilize them and begin the process of healing. TSAP also provides community trauma response following\nshootings and other instances of violence, providing a supportive debriefing space and linkage to resources in a\nlarger group setting.\n195\nCity of Pittsburgh Operating Budget Office of Community Health and Safety\nFiscal Year 2025 102300\nLaw Enforcement Assisted Diversion (LEAD)\nLaw Enforcement Assisted Diversion (LEAD) is an effective, replicable, and equitable diversion method that\nprovides individuals with intense case management. It is a client-based approach that provides people with\nsubstance use disorder and mental and behavioral health challenges, experiencing homelessness and poverty\nwith person-centered social services and intense case management focused on harm reduction and compassion\nin lieu of criminalization. The goal of LEAD is to break with traditional methods rooted in coercion and punishment\nto address the needs of individuals experiencing poverty, homelessness, substance use disorder, and mental and\nbehavioral health challenges. LEAD combats racial and ethnic disparities within the criminal-legal system that\nhave been perpetuated by harmful systems, stigmatization and lack of access to services. The initiative ignites a\npathway towards criminal justice reform specifically to end harmful policing and criminalizing minorities and\nvulnerable populations. The mission of LEAD for the City of Pittsburgh is to reduce criminal-legal system\nengagement, promote individual agency, and provide care and support to people who use drugs, people with\nmental and behavioral health challenges, and people experiencing homelessness through person-centered social\nservices. LEAD will combat racial and ethnic disparities within the criminal-legal system that have been\nperpetuated by harmful systems, stigmatization, and lack of access to services. LEAD is currently operating in\nZones 1 and 2 and will be expanding to other zones.\nPost Overdose Support Team (POST)\nThe Post Overdose Support Team (POST) responds to overdoses with teams of certified peer recovery specialists\n(CPRSs) and case managers to reach individuals at the time of interception with public safety personnel. The\nresponse aims to enable the POST team to foster a connection that places the individual in a deescalated state\nfollowing the overdose, allowing us to begin the work of providing service connections that can lead to long-term\nrecovery. Many people who have overdosed refuse transport to the hospital by EMS. This affords the POST team\nits opportunity. Trust-building that follows de-escalation is an integral initial step in order to facilitate the willingness\nof the individual to continue to engage POST staff after EMS has departed. to ensure that the provision of service\nconnections and system navigation may continue. The responding team and follow-up case management staff\nidentifies its primary goals to support safety, recovery, and to provide service connections that aim to treat\nsubstance use and/or co-occurring mental health disorders.\nReaching Out On The Streets (ROOTS)\nThe Reaching Out On The Streets (ROOTS) Program aims to reduce the prevalence of homelessness by\naddressing the social determinants of health, opening opportunities for personal agency, and intervening in critical\nmoments of crisis to reduce criminal legal interactions, increase access to services, and reduce fatal overdoses.\nROOTS will incorporate two components at full implementation: street outreach and drop-in sites. The staffing\nplan and organization align to support these programs. Interdisciplinary Zone Teams will meet the needs of\nindividuals within the hyper-local scope of available services. Interdisciplinary Zone Teams include members from\nstreet outreach, sites, and diversion programs that coordinate participant care and are adaptable to complex\nneeds; such as, human services, drug and alcohol treatment, housing, healthcare, behavioral health, and criminal\nlegal navigation.\nCommunity Engagement and Partnership\nContinued community engagement, transparency, and accountability to the community and first responders is\ncritical to building trust and facilitating change in the current response continuum. OCHS will continue to sustain a\ncollaborative model of program development and evaluation, prioritizing continuous review to ensure that deficits\nare quickly addressed and used for growth. OCHS will partner with existing community organizations and\nprioritize community members who have been harmed and may not engage in traditional meetings. Initial efforts\nwill focus on creation of multiple advisory collaboratives focused on Black neighborhoods most harmed by the war\non drugs and systemic racism. The Office of Community Health and Safety community engagement team seeks\nto build relationships and trust between the office and diverse communities in the City of Pittsburgh while\nleveraging best practices in community outreach and community engagement. Staff will accomplish their mission\nby developing programs and other initiatives in partnership with the community to enhance the quality of life,\nsafety, and security of our community.\nNote: The Office of Community Health full time positions can be found in the Stop the Violence trust fund.\n196\nCity of Pittsburgh Operating Budget Office of Community Health and Safety\nFiscal Year 2025 102300\n2024 Accomplishments\n• Launched the Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion (LEAD) program in April, piloting the program in\nPolice Zones 1 & 2.

The broad mandate of the Citizen Police Review Board is to provide\nindependent review of the conduct of the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police. To accomplish this assignment, the Board\nwill thoroughly investigate specific allegations of misconduct, hold public hearings to examine such allegations;\nevaluate current police procedures and promote safe, professional and effective law enforcement practices\nthrough public education on rights, responsibilities and police authority; and make recommendations to the Mayor\nand Chief of Police regarding police policies and procedures.\nThe Independent Citizen Police Review Board strives to improve the relationship between the community and the\nPittsburgh Bureau of Police by promoting transparency, integrity, and mutual accountability through individual\ncomplaint investigations and reviews, public hearings, and the rendering of advice to the Mayor and Chief of\nPolice on individual complaints of police conduct, police policies, practices, and procedures to ensure all are\nguided by the principles of justice, respect, and equity.\nA Board comprised of seven members appointed by the Mayor and City Council presides over the work of the\nstaff and determines all final dispositions of cases. The Board conducts public hearings and renders findings and\nrecommendations to the Chief of Police and Mayor as related to the matter or complaint under review.\nDepartmental/Bureau Overview\nInvestigation and Complaint Disposition - Citizens must file a notice of intent to file a citizen complaint with the\nCPRB within six months of the incident from which the complaint arises. Upon contact from a citizen, the Intake\nCoordinator evaluates the complaint for administrative compliance and initiates the internal case management of\nthe complaint. The Intake Coordinator informs the complainant of his/her rights and responsibilities related to the\ncomplaint. The Executive Director or the Assistant Executive Director reviews each citizen complaint, develops a\npreliminary investigative plan and assigns the case to an Investigator. The Assistant Executive Director provides\ndaily supervision and oversight of case investigations. Investigators conduct preliminary inquiries into cases and\nthe results are presented to the Board. The Board considers the evidence and determines whether to further an\ninvestigation into the allegations of misconduct or to dismiss the complaint. Complaints may proceed through\ninvestigation to a public hearing at the Board’s discretion. Findings and recommendations resulting from public\nhearings are forwarded to the Mayor and Chief of Police who must respond to the Board. Patterns emerging from\ncomplaints and allegations of misconduct may be presented to the Board for consideration of policy\nrecommendations to the Chief of Police and Mayor.\nCommunity Education - The goal of community education and outreach is to improve relations between citizens\nand police by developing or enhancing common knowledge of police authority, practices and procedures, and\ncivilian expectations of police conduct. Outreach utilizes printed material, traditional and social media, and\npersonal appearances of members and staff to ensure the public has an opportunity to be informed of the CPRB’s\nrole and common rights and responsibilities of citizenship. The effort directed to citizens (1) ensures that the\npublic is adequately prepared to respond to police encounters in a manner conducive to the safety of the citizen\nand the officer, and (2) conveys information on filing complaints when such encounters are perceived as\noffensive. The outreach to police officers is designed to encourage participation in investigations, explain the\nprocess, and integrate their concerns into the community education effort.\nBoard and Staff Development - Training for Members encompasses topics mandated by City Ordinance,\nincluding police training, police policies and procedures, criminal, civil and constitutional law as well as human\nrights and contemporary practices of civilian review of law enforcement policies and police behavior. Staff training\nis designed to enhance investigative skills, utilize technology for research and case management, and develops\nmediation and conciliation skills as well as crisis management and safety skills. Staff adheres to the standards\nand performance objectives expected of Certified Police Oversight Professionals.\nAdministrative - The Executive Director is responsible for administering the policies and procedures of the Board\nand those of the City which affect the daily operation of the Independent Citizen Police Review Board.

The aim is to increase grant-related revenue, limit the City’s exposure to any grant-related legal\nliability, and improve the efficiency and impact of programs and services funded through grant dollars.\nThe Grants Office helps departments find and apply for grant opportunities, thereby allowing each department to\nexpand its overall capacity without placing greater burden on the City’s Operating and Capital budgets. Grant\nfunds received by the City of Pittsburgh support important programs and services that the City provides to our\ncommunity. These funds allow the City to extend pre-existing services, introduce new initiatives, gain\ntechnological advances, and subsidize programmatic staffing and equipment. Grant funds are dispersed\nthroughout the City and impact a variety of efforts, including public safety, economic development, social services,\nrecreation, and infrastructure improvement and maintenance, among many others. Because grant funding allows\nthe City to leverage local public funds in order to extend and enhance the services it offers to the community, the\nimpact of grant funding upon the City of Pittsburgh is significant.\nIn 2024, the City of Pittsburgh was awarded 30 new awards for a total of $20,229,310 in funding. In particular,\nthis year the City saw an influx of infrastructure opportunities that were pursued and received resulting in a\nwindfall of grant funds to DOMI. Some projects supported by this funding include a grant to install electric vehicle\ncharging infrastructure in our communities, construct safety and accessibility improvements along the Brownsville\nRoad Corridor and install multiple intersection improvements throughout the City. Additionally, grants were\nreceived to support the City’s other departments including the renovation of Lewis Playground in Hazelwood and\nvehicles for our Park Rangers.\n296\nCity of Pittsburgh Operating Budget\nFiscal Year 2025 Grants\nActive Grants\nAmount Spent and Remaining Balances are as of November 1, 2024\nOffice of the City Clerk\nJDE Amount Amount Remaining\nFunder Grant\nNumber Awarded Spent Balance\nPA Historical Publications\n129400356 Increase access to City of Pittsburgh Records $ 8,016 $ 12,654 $ (4,638)\nand Records Commission\nNational Historical\n129400357 Publications and Museum Digitize Historic Council Records 133,934 134,171 (237)\nCommission\nDick's Sporting Goods Provide sports equipment to youth sports\n1029400411 10,000 — 10,000\nFoundation organizations in each council district\nDick's Sporting Goods Provide sports equipment to youth sports\n1029400412 10,000 — 10,000\nFoundation organizations in each council district\nDick's Sporting Goods Provide sports equipment to youth sports\n1029400413 10,000 — 10,000\nFoundation organizations in each council district\nDick's Sporting Goods Provide sports equipment to youth sports\n1029400414 10,000 — 10,000\nFoundation organizations in each council district\nDick's Sporting Goods Provide sports equipment to youth sports\n1029400415 10,000 — 10,000\nFoundation organizations in each council district\nDick's Sporting Goods Provide sports equipment to youth sports\n1029400416 10,000 — 10,000\nFoundation organizations in each council district\nDick's Sporting Goods Provide sports equipment to youth sports\n1029400417 10,000 — 10,000\nFoundation organizations in each council district\nDick's Sporting Goods Provide sports equipment to youth sports\n1029400418 10,000 — 10,000\nFoundation organizations in each council district\nDick's Sporting Goods Provide sports equipment to youth sports\n1029400419 10,000 — 10,000\nFoundation organizations in each council district\nOffice of the Mayor\nAmount Amount Remaining\nJDE Number Funder Grant\nAwarded Spent Balance\nCities for Financial\n0229400390 Establish an office of financial empowerment $ 170,000 $ 159,873 $ 10,127\nEmpowerment\n0229400391 Heinz Endowments Hire a coordinator to liaise with PPS 175,000 117,865 57,135\nCities for Financial Financial Empowerment for Summer Jobs\n0229400395 70,000 33,941 36,059\nEmpowerment participants\nOffice of Management and Budget\nAmount Amount Remaining\nJDE Number Funder Grant\nAwarded Spent Balance\nPA Department. of\n229400440 Purchase of Electric Vehicles $ 253,125 $ — $ 253,125\nEnvironmental Protection\nPA Department. of\n229400441 Electric Vehicle Infrastructure 37,028 — 37,028\nEnvironmental Protection\nEnvironmental Protection\n29400442 Diesel Vehicle Replacement 1,345,000 — 1,345,000\nAgency\nDepartment of Innovation and Performance\nAmount Amount Remaining\nJDE Number Funder Grant\nAwarded Spent Balance\nAppalachian Regional\n329400459 Digital Equity Coordinator 30,000 1,455 28,545\nCommission\n297\nCity of Pittsburgh Operating Budget\nFiscal Year 2025 Grants\nDepartment of City Planning\nAmount Amount Remaining\nJDE Number Funder Grant\nAwarded Spent Balance\nPA Department of\n1129400289 Conservation and Natural Park Master Plan $ 80,000 $ 77,547 $ 2,453\nResources\n1129400300 Regional Asset District Public Art in the Park 500,000 500,000 —\n1129400350 DCNR Fowler Park Planning 40,000 — 40,000\nPennsylvania Historical and\n1129400359 Manchester Historic Review 17,500 17,054 446\nMuseum Commission\nPA Department of\n1129400361 Community and Economic Vacant Lot Study 17,500 14,656 2,844\nDevelopment\nUS Department of\n1129400369 Composting Grant 90,000 43,336 46,664\nAgriculture\n1129400393 Heinz Endowments Assist department with a just transition 50,000 50,000 —\nPennsylvania Emergency\n1129400394 Saw Mill Run flood mitigation 300,000 — 300,000\nManagement Agency\nPennsylvania Historic and\n1129400420 Crawford Roberts Review 12,500 — 12,500\nMuseum Commission\nPennsylvania Historic and\n1129400448 Hill District property stabilization 25,000 — 25,000\nMuseum Commission\nPennsylvania Historic and\n1129400451 Historic Extension Guidelines 20,000 — 20,000\nMuseum Commission\n1129400467 US Conference of Mayors Composting Pilot 250,000 — 250,000\nPennsylvania Historic and\n1129400481 Museum Commission Mexican War Streets 25,000 — 25,000\nDepartment of Public Safety -
