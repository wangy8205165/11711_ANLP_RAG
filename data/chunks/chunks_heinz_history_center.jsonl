{"chunk_id": "0057", "source": "user_uploaded_txt", "text": "History Center Exhibits: Glass: Shattering Notions\nLong before being known as the Steel City, Pittsburgh was America’s Glass City. The Glass exhibition showcases the beauty, science, utility, and technology of Western Pennsylvania glass over the past 200 years.\n\nWhile the story of glass in America began at Jamestown in 1608, almost 200 years passed before skilled glassworkers crossed the Allegheny Mountains and began production in Western Pennsylvania. Since 1797, when the region’s first two glasshouses opened, the conical furnace stacks of glass factories have been a defining feature of the region’s skyline. By the Civil War, the Pittsburgh region reigned as the center of the nation’s glass industry.\n\nA generation later, Pittsburgh glass could be found everywhere — as tile for the walls of New York’s great transportation tunnels, in the searchlights on the Panama Canal, as insulators for endless miles of wire, in “Liberty lens” headlights for Ford automobiles, in beer halls and bars. Yet this region also produced glass fine enough for the White House tables of five U.S. presidents and embassies worldwide. Bottles by the boxcar load and singular presentation pieces — Pittsburgh factories made it all. Our factories lit the world with gas and electric streetlights, lamps, light bulbs, and lamp chimneys. Lenses and traffic signals brought safety to railways, roadways, and runways, while plate glass for large windows made department stores possible, allowing consumers to shop from the sidewalk. Storefronts of Carrera glass, basement windows of glass block, and skyscrapers sheathed in reflective glass — the uses for glass seemed endless.\n\nThe Pittsburgh region became not only a center for glass production but also for innovations in its manufacture, design, and marketing. Glass: Shattering Notions tells that story, unraveling the complex 200+ year history of this region’s first industry. Featuring more than 500 glass objects, immersive environments, hands-on interactives, and multimedia displays, the exhibit helps you look at, not through, the glass in your life and understand it in a new way.\n\nExhibit Must-Sees:\n- Zoo case – Glass birds, fish, animals, and more, all corralled in the zoo case.\n- Steamboat salts – Delicate pressed steamboat salts honoring Pittsburgh’s role as the Gateway to the West and a center for steamboat building.\n- Giant piece of glass cullet – A massive chunk of waste glass chipped from the furnace at L.E. Smith in Mount Pleasant, Pa., after a batch failed to melt properly.\n- Window glass video – Rare footage of Belgian blowers making cylinder window glass in Jeannette in 1905. Soon after, drawing machines replaced skilled blowers on factory floors.\n- Fry FOVAL lamp – A rare lamp made from the same glass the Fry Company of Rochester, Pa., used in its ovenware.\n- Pattern glass sugar bowl – Likely made by McKee Glass Co. of Pittsburgh around 1850, this sugar bowl showcases pressed glass panels as an advertisement for the company’s craftsmanship."}
