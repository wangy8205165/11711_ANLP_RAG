{"chunk_id": "0232", "text": "Pittsburgh Restaurant Week is a celebration of restaurants and dining in the steel city. Started in 2012, it's been an annual tradition to host a winter edition in January and summer edition in August. The winter edition focuses on celebrating \"New Dishes for the New Year\" while the summer edition features dishes taking advantage of the local produce and harvests with lighter fare.\n\nWhat's Required?\nIn order to participate in restaurant week, the restaurant is expected to create a limited-time small menu that is offered for dine-in guests during the dinner meals between the dates of the celebration alongside the restaurant's normal menu. While many restaurants opt for a multi-course menu with multiple options per course, that is not the designated requirement. See more details on pricing below.\n\nThe mission of Pittsburgh Restaurant Week is to highlight the wide-ranging dining options that Pittsburgh has to offer and bring individuals from surrounding boroughs or suburbs to the city to walk the streets and enjoy a meal at a special discounted price."}

Once the menu is provided, it will be posted to the restaurant's profile.\n\nMenus submitted before the posted deadline will be formatted and shared through Pittsburgh Restaurant Week's social media platforms.\n\nMenus provided after the deadline will be posted to the website but will forfeit the benefit of the social media versions being created."}

All special menus should follow that pricing model. Common pricing options include:\n\nFixed-price 3-course meal for $20.25-45.25. This variable price point allows restaurants to price their menus accordingly. Menu items do not have to come from the restaurant's regular menu, but should be representative of the restaurant's style of cooking. As an example, restaurants whose normal fixed price menu is above $35, create a special menu for Restaurant Week for $35.25.\n\n$20.25 Specialty Items in honor of Restaurant Week 2025. This could be a specialty entrée, appetizer-entrée combination, or even stretched to \"Dinner for Two\" depending on the pricing structure that best fits the restaurant.\n\nUpdated Summer 2025 Pricing:\n$250 for restaurant week menus priced $20.25 to $45.25\n$350 for restaurant week menus priced $46.25 to $55.25\n$100 late fee applied for registrations received after July 31"}

The event has grown through the years and now lasts four days. Sal Richetti, who was born and raised in Bloomfield has produced the event since 2012. Sal grew up in Bloomfield, attended Immaculate Conception grade school and Central Catholic High School. He is a local musician who has been performing for over 30 years in the tri-state area, and is the owner of Big Day Entertainment, located in the Strip District, since 1995. He is no stranger to the festival, having booked the entertainment in previous years. In 2013 he expanded it to four days. Previously, the event was always held in September, since 2013 it has moved to August. I wanted to give vendors more opportunity with the longer daylight, additionally; there is less chance of cold weather I am excited and honored to produce this community-oriented event in the community where I was born and raised. I want to be able to produce Little Italy Days so the businesses can benefit from the large crowds and everyone else including residents, organizations, schools and churches can become involved. Sponsors of Little Italy Days include Official Sponsors - Highmark & Allegheny Health Network, Stage Sponsor - Rohrich Shadyside Honda. Additional Sponsors include UPMC Shadyside, Children's Hospital of UPMC, PNC Bank, First National Bank, Mascaro, Pittsburgh Brewing Co. First Commonwealth Bank and Froggy's."}

{"chunk_id": "0293", "text": "Since its invention in 1904, the Banana Split has become an iconic part of American dessert culture. Its history began when David Strickler, a 23-year-old “soda jerk” at a drugstore in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, started experimenting with different ice cream combinations. He cut a banana lengthwise, added three scoops of ice cream – typically vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry – and initially topped it with sweet syrups, chopped nuts, whipped cream, and a maraschino cherry. It was an instant hit!\nThe Banana Split quickly gained popularity, particularly among the students at nearby St. Vincent College, who would frequent the drugstore to indulge in the delicious dessert. Strickler’s banana-based sundaes quickly became known as “Dr. Dave’s” among the students, who would rave about them to their hometown soda jerks, spreading the word about the new dessert.\nWithin a few years, the Banana Split gained national recognition. The dessert had become a staple of American dessert culture, and Strickler had become a pioneer of the ice cream industry.\nStrickler went on to buy the Latrobe pharmacy where he had invented the Banana Split, and he even added an optical business upstairs. He was a staple in the local community until he passed away in 1971 at the age of 90.\nIn 2004, on the 100th anniversary of the Banana Split, “Ice-Cream Joe” Greubel worked with the University of Pitt to commemorate Strickler’s invention with the “From Pitt Came the Split” Event.\nThe Great American Banana Split Celebration has been a staple in Latrobe since 2013, when the Pennsylvania Historical Society unveiled a marker at the former site of Tassel’s Pharmacy where Sticker was working at the time of his invention, cementing Strickler’s legacy in historical record.\nToday, the Banana Split remains a beloved dessert across the United States and is often found on the menus of ice cream shops and restaurants. It is also the official dessert of Pennsylvania!\nHonorary Chair\nIce Cream Joe Greubel\nThe legacy of Latrobe as the birthplace of the banana split might not have been fully realized had it not been for the efforts of Ice Cream Joe. While locals knew of the town’s claim to the dessert, it was Joe who in 2004, on the 100th anniversary of the invention, worked with the University of Pittsburgh on the “From Pitt Came the Split” event. He was also part of the group of Latrobeans that submitted the petition for the Pennsylvania Historical Marker that was installed in 2013.\nFrom 2015 until his passing in 2017, Joe served up ice cream, ideas, and smiles as the celebration’s honorary chair."}
