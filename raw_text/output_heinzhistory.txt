Courtesy of the Smithsonian Institution’s National Museum of American History Smithsonian Spotlight Model of the Rodman Process pioneered at the Fort Pitt Foundry, c. 1864 (base added in 1878) The first gun built using the Rodman hollow casting process was made at the Fort Pitt Foundry in the 1850s. In 1860, the War Department commissioned Rodman to build the world’s first 15-inch cannon. By 1864, Rodman had also supervised the fabrication of a massive 20-inch gun. This model depicts the specialized intricate casting apparatus used in making the first 20-inch Rodman, which required nearly 80 tons of molten iron poured from three furnaces. A complex four-piece mold was required to shape the cannon, which was cast in an upright position. The completed 20-inch gun barrel, one of six made at the Fort Pitt Foundry, weighed 117,000 pounds. This model educated West Point Military Academy cadets on the casting techniques pioneered in Pittsburgh. Courtesy of the Smithsonian Institution’s National Museum of American History Smithsonian Spotlight KDKA transmitter, c. 1921 In the days when there were few regulations for radios, Frank Conrad, a Westinghouse engineer, built a makeshift studio in his garage and played records over the airwaves. His supervisor at Westinghouse, Harry P. Davis saw Conrad’s hobby as a great way to sell more radios, and they applied for the first commercial radio license. On October 27, 1920, they received the call letters KDKA and set up a small studio in Westinghouse’s East Pittsburgh Works. On November 2, KDKA broadcast the election results between Harding and Cox, credited as the first commercial radio broadcast. Courtesy of the Smithsonian Institution’s National Museum of American History This replica transmitter retains some parts from Frank Conrad’s original, which is credited with the first commercial radio broadcast.

About - Heinz History Center About the Heinz History Center Skip Sub Navigation Explore This Section Close The Senator John Heinz History Center is Pennsylvania’s largest history museum and a proud affiliate of the Smithsonian Institution . Devoted to the history and heritage of Western Pennsylvania, our family of museums includes the Heinz History Center, Western Pennsylvania Sports Museum, Fort Pitt Museum, and Meadowcroft Rockshelter and Historic Village. The History Center is home to the Thomas & Katherine Detre Library & Archives. Our mission is to engage and inspire large and diverse audiences through programs that enable links to the past, understanding in the present, and guidance for the future by preserving regional history and presenting the American experience with a Western Pennsylvania connection. This work is accomplished in partnership with others through archaeology, archives, artifact collections, broadcast and electronic media, civic engagement, conservation, educational programs, exhibitions, events, library, museums, public outreach, performance, preservation, publications, products, research, technical assistance, and virtual programs. Our Story The Senator John Heinz History Center traces its roots back to 1879, making it the oldest cultural institution in Western Pennsylvania. In 1879, the Old Residents of Pittsburgh and Western Pennsylvania established a historical society to help preserve local history. Five years later, the name changed to the Historical Society of Western Pennsylvania and has been in continuous existence for more than 135 years. Originally, membership in the historical society was limited to men who had lived in the region for 50 years or more, though the rules changed within a few years to include women and younger people. In those days, members enjoyed lectures and country outings and got together to reminisce. Perhaps most importantly, early Historical Society members worked to preserve archival materials and objects of historic significance, forming the foundation of the History Center’s collections. The Historical Society brought our region’s history to the public. In 1908, it celebrated the region’s 150th anniversary; in 1911, the centennial of steamboat navigation; in 1958, the region’s bicentennial celebration; and in 2008, the region’s 250th anniversary. These events served as the basis for the many events, publications, educational programs, and exhibitions that the History Center offers today. Early meetings of the Historical Society were held in members’ homes and churches, though a significant step was taken in 1893 when the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh at Schenley Park offered space for the archives. In 1914, after securing the funding, the Historical Society built its own building on Bigelow Blvd. In 1996, the History Center moved into its current home in Pittsburgh’s Strip District. With the opening of the Smithsonian wing in 2004, the History Center became the largest history museum in Pennsylvania. The new wing allows better opportunities found in our affiliation with the Smithsonian Institution. The additional space added the Western Pennsylvania Sports Museum, the Mueller Education Center, the Special Collections Gallery, and the McGuinn Gallery for traveling exhibitions. Since its opening, the Smithsonian wing has been home to various exhibitions, including Pennsylvania’s Civil War, Vatican Splendors, 1968: The Year that Rocked America, Pittsburgh’s Lost Steamboat: Treasures of the Arabia, We Can Do It! WWII, Toys of the ’50s, ’60s and ’70s, #Pixburgh: A Photographic Experience, Destination Moon: The Apollo 11 Mission. In 2014, the History Center opened the new Museum Conservation Center, located directly behind the museum on Penn Avenue. The nine-story building houses the museum’s artifacts under one roof with Smithsonian-quality storage. Heinz History Center As Pittsburgh’s “people museum,” the History Center preserves and interprets the history of Western Pennsylvanians through six floors of interactive exhibitions that feature iconic artifacts like the TV set from “Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood” and the world’s oldest jeep.

Fort Pitt Museum Internship The Fort Pitt Museum is dedicated to preserving the history of Fort Pitt and Pittsburgh during the French and Indian War, Pontiac’s Rebellion, Lord Dunmore’s War, the American Revolution, and the Ohio Country Indian wars of the 1790’s. The museum comprises two floors of exhibit space, an active education program, and a living history program depicting both military and civilian life on the frontier. The museum’s permanent exhibits are continually being improved, and temporary exhibits are periodically developed. Interns may choose to work in research or exhibit fabrication, depending upon student skills, interest and current departmental needs. The education department oversees both regular group visitation and scouting programs. Interns will be assigned projects related to historical research, curriculum development, docent training, or special events depending upon student interest and current departmental needs. Interns may choose visible roles (front of house tour guiding) or behind the scenes roles. Living history demonstrations take place in Point State Park and range from campfire cooking to firing of a replica cannon. Interns to this department will be assigned projects related to historical research, program development, performing costumed interpretation, or special events depending upon student interest and current departmental needs. African American Program Internships The African American Collection is an initiative of the African American Program (AAP) and comprises over 300 Library & Archives sources that are primary to the understanding of historical experiences of African Americans in Western Pennsylvania. In addition, artifacts and material culture are housed in the museum of the History Center and make up the basis of the exhibition and preservation of local material history. These collections provide students, researchers, scholars, media professionals, writers, and others with a primary source of information about African Americans in Western Pennsylvania. Books, theses, dissertations, documentaries, and other forms of academic, educational, and cultural products have been derived from the AAC. Please check out the AAC webpage for a depth look. Internships provide practical and applicable skills and knowledge in historic research, collections management, and exhibit development and research. Preference will be given to graduate student or undergraduate juniors or seniors with research skills.

The program works closely with a diverse group of researchers, partner organizations, and community groups in the tri-state and beyond. Interns may be asked to assist with researching collections and historical topics, preparing content for public programming, or other research and writing-based tasks.
