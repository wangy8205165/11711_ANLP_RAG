Urban Development. Since 1984, the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust, a non-profit arts organization, has worked to make the Steel City a place where the arts can flourish.

Pittsburgh’s Cultural District stands as a nationwide model for how the arts can play a pivotal role in urban revitalization. Each year, millions of people visit the Cultural District to expand their horizons in our theaters, galleries, and public art environments. Patrons enjoy thousands of world-class performing arts events and visual arts exhibitions . Pittsburgh residents of all ages connect and learn with the Trust’s comprehensive education and community engagement opportunities. Local arts organizations collaborate to build a stronger cultural community through the power of partnerships . The Cultural District acts as the anchor for all of that work. The Trust’s superior venues and gallery spaces allow resident companies, community organizations, artists, and promoters to reach audiences large and small. In total, the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust manages more than one million square feet of real estate in the District. Step outside those buildings to find numerous public art installations that beautify Pittsburgh's largest arts neighborhood. Lauded as “the single greatest creative force in Pittsburgh because of its spirit of reinvention” by the Pittsburgh Post Gazette, the Trust strives every day to enrich the city of Pittsburgh’s vibrancy, diversity, and prosperity.

First Name* Last Name Email* Phone Please verify your request* Submit About the Harris Theater The Pittsburgh Cultural Trust's Harris Theater is one of the most active arts facilities in the region showing art films nearly every day of the year. Formerly known as the Art Cinema, the Harris Theater represents a milestone in the redevelopment of Liberty Avenue. The Art Cinema was the first moving picture house in Pittsburgh to commercially show art movies until competition from other city theaters led to its conversion to an adult movie house in the 1960s. As part of its mission to transform the Cultural District, the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust purchased and restored the facility leading to further conversions of run-down properties along the Liberty Avenue corridor. With a total of 194 seats, including a fully restored balcony, the Harris Theater officially opened to the public for movies and live performances on November 9, 1995. The theater is one of the few that has retained 35mm film projectors that are utilized regularly. The Harris was named through a gift from the Buhl Foundation after John P. Harris, co-founder of the Nickelodeon—the first theater solely dedicated to the showing of motion pictures—and a Pennsylvania State Senator. The Harris Theater features contemporary, foreign, and classic films. Films For All The Harris Theater has installed the necessary equipment to provide closed movie captioning and audio description to patrons for digital films that offer these features. Films with captioning and audio description available will be noted when available. Support the Harris Theater and Become a Member!

A New Theater, a Significant Sketch, and a Giant Duck: Three Big Moments in Trust History | The Pittsburgh Cultural Trust | @CulturalTrust Close Window Time Out You have exceeded the time limit and your seats have been released. A New Theater, a Significant Sketch, and a Giant Duck: Three Big Moments in Trust History Tue, Sep 30, 2025 Written by: Andy Sharfman The Cultural Trust has been around since 1984 and—if you've joined us at any point during our 41-year journey—you know it's been an eventful ride. We've welcomed legendary performers to our stages and festivals (from Bob Dylan to India.Arie), launched countless debut productions (name anything from the Pittsburgh International Festival of Firsts), and breathed new life into venues throughout the Cultural District (seven theater spaces total). With four decades of milestones behind us, you could throw a dart at the calendar and likely hit some anniversary at the Cultural Trust. But recently, while flipping through our archives, we noticed something especially interesting about this time of year. Three significant moments in our organization's history all occurred within the same six-day window—September 25 to October 1—spread across a 26-year period. For curious Pittsburgh history buffs and Cultural Trust enthusiasts alike, let's take a trip down memory lane. Happy Birthday to the Benedum! The Benedum Center, formerly known as The Stanley Theater, opened on Friday, September 25, 1987, with a three-day show called Purely Pittsburgh. The show was written by Dan Langen and produced by Mandy Levine and featured composers from Pittsburgh and performers with local connections, including the Pittsburgh Jazz Orchestra and CLO Mini Stars. Check out the program for the event, and learn more about renovation and the grand opening that followed. An exterior sketch for the restored theater A Precursor to Agnes R. Katz Plaza "Art is a Guarantee of Sanity,” a selection of sculptures and drawings by Louise Bourgeois from 1951 to 1992, exhibited at Wood Street Galleries on October 1, 1992. If Bourgeois’ name sounds familiar, there is a reason! The show included a preliminary drawing of what is now Agnes R. Katz Plaza. Bourgeois was a prolific artist who exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art, Tate Modern, Venice Biennale, National Gallery of Canada and was honored by the National Women's Hall of Fame. Agnes R. Katz Plaza with Louise Bourgeois sculptures. The Rubber Duck Project Designed by Studio Florentijn Hofman from the Netherlands, the iconic giant rubber duck premiered at the Allegheny River on September 27, 2013, drawing tens of thousands of visitors, as part of the Pittsburgh International Festival of Firsts. The rubber duck was 40 ft tall and 30 ft wide. A crowd catches a glimpse of the giant rubber duck from the Roberto Clemente Bridge. Inspired by these historic moments, we’re filling our archive with new milestones everyday— moments when we reimagine our venues, create more artistic spaces for our community, and inspire you- our visitors- to experience something extraordinary. We hope you’ll join us for more! Tags: history Benedum Looking for more? Join our email list and get priority access to tickets, news, and events! Email* Join Join Our Newsletter! Learn More

A Puppy’s Guide Dog Training: The Benedum Center Edition | The Pittsburgh Cultural Trust | @CulturalTrust Close Window Time Out You have exceeded the time limit and your seats have been released. A Puppy’s Guide Dog Training: The Benedum Center Edition Wed, Aug 20, 2025 Written by: Andy Sharfman | Photos by: Krist Munoz-Malave On a warm spring day, a special guest approaches the Benedum Center front doors. He’s wearing a blue bandana and he’s very excited to visit a new place where he can discover new smells and meet new people. Ace, a 5-month-old Black Lab and a guide-dog-in-training, isn’t here to see a show, though. He’s here to work. His handler, Kelli Hughes, patiently waits for him to settle down before heading inside. Once he’s calm, she brings Ace into the Benedum Center lobby to begin his training. “The energy he comes in with is the energy he’ll have through the experience,” she explains. By waiting, she can make sure he’s in the right head space from the start. In this edition of Accessibility in Action , you'll learn how dogs like Ace make a difference, what goes into raising service animals, and how you can support both the dogs and their handlers when you see them at the theater. Understanding their work helps us create a welcoming space where everyone can enjoy the arts together. From Empty Nesters to Puppy Raisers Recently, Kelli and her husband Rich became empty nesters and, naturally, they started considering what would come next. At the end of January, they welcomed Ace, a 9-week-old puppy, into their household of two dogs, some chickens, and a few cats (his favorite playmates). The young Black Lab came to the couple through Leader Dog for the Blind , a Michigan-based organization that provides guide dogs, white cane training, and other services to individuals who are blind or visually impaired—all at no cost to them. Before these individuals receive their dogs, volunteers (or "puppy raisers" as Leader Dog calls them) invest in significant training time. During their orientation, Kelli learned that this commitment takes about 3 million minutes over 12 to 15 months. Despite all this effort, puppy raisers don’t go it alone. Leader Dog provides these volunteers with supplies to get them started, and they give support at every step of the process, including an extensive manual, weekly timelines, and regular check-ins with a puppy counselor. While the training process seemed intense, Kelli wasn’t too fazed. In fact, she's been wanting to raise guide dogs ever since she saw one featured on the back cover of a World magazine as a kid. Years later, Kelli and Rich’s motivation has grown through personal experience. Their daughter is deaf and blind, and although she isn’t able to use a guide dog, her parents understand how much mobility independence can make a difference. Training in Progress Leader Dog asks puppy raisers to expose their dogs to as many different experiences as possible during the first 18 months. From daily lessons to regular field trips, Kelli and Rich have embraced that challenge wholeheartedly. So far, Ace has been exposed to distractions like loud hair dryers, crowded stores, and bikes whizzing by on trails. They even brought out their kids' old toys— maracas, kazoos, and noisemakers—so that he’s prepared to exercise discipline in the face of distractions. Although Ace is only a puppy, he has reacted to most of these stimuli with remarkable calm. "He's so chill," says Rich. "He's barked maybe two or three times since we've had him." Ace is also developing spatial awareness by balancing on a step stool. His flexibility has earned him the nickname "The Great Caterpillar" for his ability to bend and weave out of the way—a skill that will prove useful when guiding someone through crowded theaters or store aisles. Impulse control, particularly around food, is another crucial lesson. In restaurants, for example, guide dog users need to be confident that their dog won't reach for food on tables or floors. This discipline extends beyond basic manners, too. When working outdoors, guide dogs must ignore dropped food that could divert their attention from oncoming traffic and other potential dangers. He's also mastering how to go to the bathroom on command, on any surface, and in any location—which a guide dog will need to do before their owner walks into work, as an example. Although Ace is impressively well-behaved, he’s still very much a puppy. Kelli jokes about his current challenge: “He has a thing for socks and shoes right now. And it’s flip-flop season.” "If someone else can benefit from this, if we can change their life, then that's what we want to do," Kelli explains. Back to the Theater Ace’s trip to the Benedum Center is about learning how to navigate the unique environment of a theater—the same skills his future owner will need to confidently attend cultural events. Water is often a distraction for labs, but Ace isn’t distracted when Kelli and Rich flush toilets or turn on faucets. That’s a good sign. He walks up and down carpeted stairs —going down is still a little tougher, Rich notes—and rides the elevator. He also practices walking alongside theater seats and even visits the Hughes’ balcony seats for the Broadway season. "Impulse control is the focus," Rich explains as they take breaks to let Ace reset. He demonstrates his technique, adding, "When they pull you, anchor yourself.” And Kelli jokes "Our left forearms are so much stronger now.” Practicing Ace’s skills at the Benedum is important, especially because the Hughes see art as something everyone should be able to access. They're long-time Broadway subscribers; one son was active in high school theater; and the other works in security for the Cultural Trust. “Music is the universal communicator,” Kelli says. “Even if someone can’t hear it, they can still feel it. Everyone should have access to that experience.” Learning Guide Dog Etiquette At the end of their visit to the Benedum, Kelli removes Ace's bandana—which he knows means he can be a regular puppy again. He's quick to ask for pets and gives everyone kisses. Kelli says that he’ll sleep soundly on the car ride home. But he'll be ready to return to duty the moment his bandana goes back on. During all his training sessions, Ace wears his blue and red bandana—which is a sign to passersby that he's working, not playing. When people want to pet him, the Hughes are ready go-to replies: "He's practicing;" "He's working;" "Please respect the process." You’ve likely seen dogs like Ace wearing harnesses in public. But not all of these working animals are seeing eye dogs like this puppy aspires to be. Service dogs can also be used by people with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, paralysis, seizures, hearing loss, diabetes, mental health disorders, and many other conditions. Regardless of their job, the etiquette is the same: don’t touch or interact unless their harness is off, and their owner gives you permission. Building Independence At 15 months, Ace will return to the Leader Dog campus in Michigan for 16 weeks of formal training with professional instructors. There, he'll learn formal harness training and guide dog skills like stopping at curbs, avoiding obstacles, and finding doors. While Ace’s journey to becoming a guide dog is not guaranteed—the organization has about a 30% success rate—dogs in the program often find success in different careers like police work, medical assistance, or search and rescue. For now, Ace continues learning. In a week's time, he'll return to the Benedum for a venue tour with a small group. And soon, he'll progress to a halter, attend recreational softball games, and try out public transit. If all goes according to plan, he’ll come back to the Benedum this fall—this time for his very first Broadway show. That means you may see a cute Black Lab at your next performance. But if you see him or any other guide dog, just remember: They’re working. The Pittsburgh Cultural Trust welcomes registered service dogs and miniature horses in all theaters and facilities. Service dogs in training, when accompanied by approved trainers, are also welcome as they learn to navigate public spaces.

Volunteer Close Window Time Out You have exceeded the time limit and your seats have been released. Time left to complete order Volunteering Great Performances. Great People. Give the gift of time! Our volunteers play an important role at The Pittsburgh Cultural Trust by providing support and leadership for our programs, projects and activities. Comprised of people of all ages and backgrounds, our corps of volunteers works to strengthen community awareness and public appreciation for the Trust, contribute to its financial strength, and provide vital support services to its staff. How to Apply Thank you for your interest in supporting the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust. To complete your Volunteer Application Form online, you will be directed to a new site powered by Better Impact, where you can create or log into an existing account. APPLY NOW Are you a student looking to volunteer? Check out our Beyond the Stage student volunteer program! Volunteer FAQs How old do I have to be to volunteer? Minimum age requirement is 16 years of age. There is no maximum age limit, although we ask that you be mindful of the physical requirements of volunteering. What are the physical requirements to volunteer? Volunteers must be able to stand for extended periods of time, especially during the portions of the shift when guests enter, exit, and otherwise navigate the venue (intermission, etc.) You must also be comfortable navigating slightly sloped passageways and steps in dimly lit or dark spaces of the theater. What is the time commitment for a shift? Each event is very different, but a typical shift is between 4-6 hours. You will see the start and approximate end times very clearly in the online portal before signing up for a shift. What is the time commitment year-round? We ask that every volunteer do at least 75 hours in a calendar year to remain an active volunteer in the program. New volunteers must complete 25 hours within the first 90 days after their orientation. What are the uniform requirements? We ask that you provide a white button-down long sleeve dress shirt, black dress pants, fully black shoes, and black socks. The Trust will provide you with a black vest and a basic black bowtie. Outdoor events are casual attire, or an event T-shirt may be provided. In-depth uniform requirements will be covered at the orientation. What opportunities are included if I sign up to volunteer? We have many opportunities year-round to volunteer. Theater opportunities include events at the Benedum Theater, Byham Theater, Greer Cabaret Theater, or Liberty Magic. We do NOT offer opportunities at Heinz Hall or the O’Reilly Theater through this program. Other opportunities include the Three Rivers Arts Festival , First Night Festival , Gallery Crawls , helping with Tours of our venues, and other miscellaneous events. What will I be doing as a volunteer? The volunteer function varies depending on the show and whether it is an indoors or outdoors event, but our volunteers handle various guest-facing tasks such as scanning tickets, greeting patrons, taking patrons to their seat, coat check room support, and donor lounge support. How does scheduling work? Scheduling is flexible! You pick and choose your own shifts. All our scheduling is done through an online portal that is very easy to use. Because there are so many different events that you can sign up for, people from all walks of life (students, working, retired, etc.) are able to make it work due to the flexible scheduling. How often are orientations? Once every quarter. Each one is on a Saturday from 9am-5pm at the Benedum or Byham theaters. What happens after I apply? Please note that not all applicants are accepted. After applying, you will receive an email prompting you to take a short quiz about this FAQ section. After that, you will be prompted to reach out and schedule a 15-20 min phone screening interview. If you pass these steps, you will be invited to attend the next orientation. What happens after orientation? If you’ve got your uniform components ready, you are welcome to start signing up to volunteer! (Please see the question above for uniform requirements. The vest will be provided at your first volunteering shift after your orientation). Your first 90 days will be a “shadowing” period, where you will be paired up with another volunteer to learn the ropes at any shift you attend. Can I come to part of an orientation? No. You will have to be there for the entirety of the orientation to be eligible for the program. The reason for the long orientation is that we are preparing you for so many volunteering opportunities in our Cultural District. What about parking? We provide parking validation in the Theater Square Parking garage for any volunteering shift or training that you participate in. Are there short-term volunteering commitments available? Currently, we do not have any short-term or “day of service” volunteering opportunities available. Please contact the Volunteer Services and Front of House Guest Experience department for more information ( rieser@trustarts.org ). What kind of environment is this volunteer experience? It is a fun, fast-paced, team-driven environment where you interact with guests and make sure they are having magical experiences! I know some people who want to join, what should they do? Have them apply at trustarts.org/volunteer . Everyone must individually do an application, FAQ quiz, phone call, and attend an orientation to be eligible to volunteer. They can email vthomas@trustarts.org if they have any questions! Will I get to watch the show? Volunteers are responsible for creating magical guest experiences for our patrons. The main function of the volunteer program is to share a love of the arts with our guests and create an environment where they want to return time and again. With this focus in mind, volunteers do not get to see the entirety of a performance. An opportunity to watch portions of the events must be balanced with the primary responsibility of ensuring that guests' needs are met and given priority. Volunteer Mission Statement Our priority is to help others enjoy the beautiful gift of art by creating a warm atmosphere and unforgettable experiences that excite and attract diverse audiences again and again to our venues and festivals. The Cultural Trust’s community of volunteers supports and cultivates an environment where all feel welcome to enjoy performing, visual, and public art.

We aspire to provide all with a fulfilling and gratifying experience in the arts.

Volunteers may participate in activities in the following areas: Performance Support Festival Support Children’s Activities Support Gallery Attendant Program Docent Program Programmatic-specific Support, including assisting with various departmental needs Giving is Rewarding. Becoming a volunteer makes you a part of theTrust family.

Krystal recently moved from Georgia with her parents and decided to join PCT to meet people. If you happen to see Krystal be sure to welcome her to Pittsburgh and ‘the PCT family’. July 13, 2024 – Brad Williams – Connie O'Connor New Volunteers! June 6, 2024 – Three Rivers Arts Festival – Denise Morelli Not only does Susan Gordon go above and beyond by providing a sweet start to events with her notorious Candy Bag, but she also added the extra touch at the TRAF booth sitting. Notice the booth owner’s dog in this picture. Her dog sitting business came in handy in providing professional knowledge adding to the PCT magical experience. 2024 Children's Theater Festival – a success! Beyond the Stage – Awards Ceremony We successfully wrapped up year 2 of the Beyond the Stage volunteer program with an awards ceremony. Special thanks to Hayley Haldeman who attended and spoke with the students! Special shout out goes to Madison who was the most active student for the second year in a row! She had 75 hours this year and received an Outstanding Act of Volunteer Service (OAVS) medallion! This academic year, we had 37 people in the program participate, and they totaled 1150.24 hours volunteering! That averages out to about 31 hours per student! BTS volunteers participated in over 45 different shows throughout the year! They volunteered at many different locations!: Benedum, Byham, Greer Cabaret, Liberty Magic, Gallery Crawl, Children's Theater Festival, JazzLive, Three Rivers Arts Festival, First Night Festival, Artist Car Workshop April 30, 2024 – Hayley Haldeman Ticket Scanning Hayley, the Cultural Trust's Chief Administrative Officer, scanned tickets during the April 30 Jesus Christ Superstar shift! April 30, 2024 – The Passion of Mary Cardwell Dawson – Marilyn Egan (Pittsburgh Opera's Director of Education) I was impressed with the FOH staff and security at the Byham last night. Greg, Goia, and Caleb went out of their way to help patrons with visual impairments get through security, ticket scanning, and move up the LONG ramp at the Byham. Don Sivavec, House Manager, was also helpful with wheelchair use on the ramp AND in the theater. Some of our patrons have multiple disabilities and the PCT staff has been caring and helpful to them in so many ways. April 24, 2024 – Harris Theater Rent screening Thank you to the 80 volunteers that came to the Harris Theater to watch RENT! We hope everyone had a wonderful time and enjoyed the tasty popcorn, prizes, and camaraderie! April 19, 2024 – Greer post-show event – Kathy Griffin April 19, 2024 – Company – Paul Armbruster On the Friday, April 19, performance of Company I experienced something in all my fourteen years as an usher plus two years as a manager, that I never experienced before. I was standing at Mezzanine house left when a young man came up to me and said, “My wife is immunosuppressed and where we are sitting there are a lot of people around us. Would it be possible for us to move where there are less people?” Fortunately for them the Mezzanine and Balcony levels did have many empty seats that night. I replied, “I can move you into this row (pointing at row K." I felt compelled to talk to the couple so I moved into the empty row and while leaving a seat between us I asked the girl, “Are you a recipient?” She replied that she was a heart recipient. I said to them, “I am a recipient as well. I had a liver transplant and this coming October 5th will be 22 years since my transplant!” Their eyes opened wide with amazement. She informed me that it is almost one year since her transplant operation. We briefly talked about transplantation then I left them to enjoy the show. However, I felt, and I think that she felt as well, an immediate and unique bond between us. It was the first time I met a patron who was a fellow recipient. I know that after such a serious operation how it’s natural to have a fear that something still may go wrong. However, I hope that I was able to provide her with some inspiration that her future would be bright. As they passed me on their way out after the show the young man extended his hand and as we shook hands, I wished them “Good luck!” Although they were both wearing masks, I could clearly see that they were both smiling from ear to ear. Maybe, just maybe, I made a difference that night. April 13, 2024 – Dog Man the Musical – note from a Patron My family and I visited the Byham Theater yesterday, April 13th for the DogMan Musical with my 8-year-old son who is an AVID DogMan fan, and we just wanted to let you all know about the absolutely FANTASTIC time we had! We often use Kulture City sensory bags when we visit PNC Park, so when my son learned that they were offered at the theater, he was thrilled. From the moment we entered, though, the staff was phenomenal - friendly, knowledgeable, accommodating - fabulous all around! This was our first visit to this theater, but rest assured we will return! Thank you so much for a great experience! My son had the night of his life, and we enjoyed watching him have a blast. April 13, 2024 – Barb Mills I was in the ladies room leaving @ the Opera Brown Bag recital, & I overhead a random patron waiting in the long line. 'When I go to the Benedum, the ushers there are so nice & do a great job of moving the Ladies Room line along'. I said Thank You on behalf of the Cultural Trust Staff; she had no idea I am an usher! My heart smiled. April 11, 2024 – Wait! Wait! Don't Tell Me! – Laura Kubicki I want to give a huge shout-out to the "Dream Team" of six volunteers on the Mezzanine Level during the Thursday, 04/11 performance of Wait! Wait! Don't Tell Me! Kudos to Judy Cunningham, Denise Filipino, Linda Cwynar, Carol Yurechko, Sandra Deforno, and Kim Weismann. These fantastic ushers worked extremely well together - a true team effort! Judy, Denise, Linda, and Carol seated patrons quite efficiently and with great enthusiasm. Kim and Sandra were Directors and stationed outside each Mezzanine door. They welcomed each guest, checked their tickets, and accurately directed patrons onto the Mezzanine level or up to the Balcony level. This teamwork was very much appreciated by a sold-out theater of patrons. Thank you all once again! March 31, 2024 – Mamma Mia A special shout out to all the volunteers and staff who participated during a busy Easter weekend with sold out shows! March 29, 2024 – Mamma Mia – Jonathan Nadle During the Friday evening show, a couple was brought into guest services for a ticket issue - one that apparently wasn't of their own making. It was pushing 8 PM and Matt worked quickly to get them good tickets. The gentleman looked concerned, so I reassured him they still had 7 minutes to be seated. He looked relieved and thanked us, saying, "Everyone is so helpful. That's why we keep coming back." I directed them to the proper inner lobby door, another usher took over, and they made it to their seats just before the hold. March 19, 2024 – La Traviata – Barbara Mills I ushered my first Opera last evening in the Mezzanine with Wayne [Madden], and I loved it. The Opera patrons were very gracious! I loved it so much I emailed Mr. Christopher Hahn, thanking him for keeping Opera alive in Pittsburgh. He responded quickly, and was touched that I reached out. My next show to usher is Herbie Hancock, which I am looking forward to. March 17, 2024 – La Traviata – Diane Reimer House manager Jordyn Smith always stops by to speak to the ushers during a performance to ask how it's going and to say thanks. I was working on the Promenade on Saturday evening when she stopped by during an intermission. She has done this every time when I have been there for a performance and she is a house manager. I appreciate that she takes the time during a show to do this. Thank you, Jordyn! February 16, 2024 – PBT Beauty and the Beast – Diane Basty I had some wonderful experiences at the Friday night performance of the ballet, Beauty and the Beast, at the Benedum. Great reminders of how fortunate we are to work for The Trust and with one another. We, as a whole, provide and receive great reward in what our roles are within our venues. As a backdrop, the sparkle of the snow set a beautiful outdoor setting. A distinguished gentleman turned to me with noticeable excitement as he entered the Benedum and said, “we’ve never seen snow before, we’re from Texas!”. His awe stayed with me the duration of the night. If that wasn’t enough, shortly following this, a car pulled up and as we approached the car door, the most adorable young girl stepped out in full ball gown; head to toe, as Belle! She stopped the show for us. You never know what’s around the corner! Note from Susan Godron A sweet little girl gave me this picture she drew February 21, 2024 – The Life and Music of George Michael – Justin Williams I wanted to take a moment to acknowledge Dan Hadfield for his pragmatic resolution of an issue in Box 112 tonight. The guests with those seats requested 3 bariatric chairs and we only had 1 available. Dan spoke with them and was able to provide a bench and the guests were very pleased with his accommodation. Additionally, Paul Armbruster was able to assist a guest that was apprehensive to use the stairs from the balcony elevator to Row F by allowing her and her companion to sit in Row L on the Gallery Level. February 23, 2024 – Rainbow Fish Student Matinee – Kevin Wilkes Our FOH team had the Friday Fish (Rainbow) Special in full effect at the Byham today! Our House and floor managers were great today as well as well as all of our fantastic volunteers. They took extra special care of all the little tadpoles today. They Byham was filled with children for some great programing from our Trust Arts Education team. Special shoutout to Mary Levine! She was a rockstar as our bus wrangler. She left no student behind . Kudos to EVERYONE! Greer – Judy Campagna I wanted to let you know how much I love working at the Greer with Don and his management staff. Feel like part of the family there…even with waiters, bartenders, and bar manager. Really enjoyed the show The Perfect Mate and we had a really nice volunteer crew working it. First Night A highlight of the evening was the revamped tours program with trained staff and volunteers this year. In total, we gave tours to over 900 people at the Benedum and 700 at the Byham! Most Hours Volunteered in 2023 She’s done it again! Ginny Kasserman finished with the most hours for the second consecutive year in a row. In 2023, she had a staggering 703.18 HOURS. To put that in perspective, that equates to over 29 FULL DAYS of volunteering in a year! (That’s more than all of February – even in a leap year!) As a reward for her incredible services, Ginny received a complimentary one-year membership to the Trust donors’ lounges! We are thankful to everyone who contributes their time to create magical guest experiences with us year-round, and we are especially grateful to Ginny for her enormous contributions! Thank you for all that you do, Ginny! December 2, 2023 – Mrs. Doubtfire November 26, 2023 – Phyllis Boykin What a treat for some FOH team members- the true stars of the evening! What an honor to have a picture with the famous Mirror Ball trophy from Dancing With The Stars. November 20, 2023 – Laura Kubicki Kudos and a huge thank you to the “Dream Team” of Cindy McCormick, Linda Cwynar, Carol Yurechko, Ruthie Fox, Nancy Geraci, Sharon Greb, Michelle Radziminski, and Kim Weismann - the eight volunteer ushers who worked the sold out Rock Orchestra by Candlelight show! They worked fabulously together as a team, whether it be seating patrons, pleasantly interacting with many first-time patrons, covering the long line at the ladies room during intermission, or taking turns guarding the ever-important exit doors, they did their roles with enthusiasm and gusto! Thank you all! October 31, 2023 – Christine Castner I feel very much a part of a team and my role as a volunteer is that of support. My eyes have been opened to the depth of the Cultural Trust and I am amazed at this remarkable organization within our city. I am proud to be able to be connected to and support the Trust. I am being rewarded with remarkable benefits of experiences with every shift I am able to take. I truly love this volunteer experience. October 23, 2023 – Beyond The Stage Launch & New Volunteers – Vinay Thomas I am so thrilled to share that we have launched year 2 of our Beyond The Stage student volunteer program with just over 30 new students from CAPA! In addition to the students, we also welcomed in many new volunteers this weekend at the latest new volunteer orientation! October 6, 2023 – Sugar Skull Student Matinee October 1, 2023 – Artist Car Workshop – Barb M. It was a great day for the Artist Car Workshop. Cultural Trust Volunteers, Barb Martinelli and Shelly Hartge pitched in to help artist, Cheryl Capezzuti, and her crew prepare cars for the downtown Pittsburgh New Years' Eve celebration. September 27, 2023 – Moulin Rouge – Roseann B. Being emeritus I’m not able to usher as often as I’d like, but when I do it’s always great! Especially the opening night of Moulin Rouge. Not only was the show so good, but the people I encountered really made my evening! There was the couple who had just moved from Wisconsin and was so thrilled to be there, the gentlemen who had never been to the Benedum and was in awe of our beautiful theater and, of course, the people I worked with. Our floor manager, Erica in the mezzanine, was so nice and fun!. I enjoyed ushering and talking with Andrea, who had some very interesting stories, and of course my BFF, Louise who I met as a result of ushering. And it’s always nice when I get to see ladies and gentlemen who I’ve met over the years. You know who you are. When people say we do this to see the shows they may be right but it’s so much more than that! September 25, 2023 – Note from Denise M Everyone has been beyond welcoming and kind. I’m loving my experiences. Thank you. September 24, 2023 – Bluey's Big Play – Deb B. My Grandson, Clark and I attended the Saturday morning Bluey performance! He had the time of his life meeting my fellow Volunteers/Floor & House Managers, and particularly getting a big soft pretzel and Bluey light toy! The theater was full of Bluey fans! September 22, 2023 – Beyond The Stage Year 2 Launch – Vinay T. We are continuing our Beyond the Stage program and have added more student volunteers from Pittsburgh CAPA. The program begins soon and you will see these students in the theaters following the next orientation on October 21! September 15, 2023 – Tick, Tick..Boom! – Carol W. Shout out to Kathy who was one of the first five ushers to work the new Greer and help management there iron out kinks before tickets go live. September 14, 2023 – Steve Martin & Martin Short – Carol W. Shout out to new usher Sylvia, who I worked with on the prom on Thursday night for Steve Martin and Martin Short. It was really busy, and she expressed frustration that she made a couple of missteps. But she was a star in my eyes. She worked like a trooper, climbing up and down the stairs, helping people to get to their seats. And she stuck with it. She’s going to be a great usher. Let’s encourage her! September 13, 2023 – Ray LaMontagne – Crystal S. Frank -ticket scanner - is always very happy and enthusiastic. Frank's energy is contagious. Also willing to share a laugh with a very cute joke. September 11, 2023 – Volunteer Appreciation Party – Vinay T. I am so delighted to share a special good news edition following our amazing Volunteer Appreciation Party last week at the Byham. We say it time and time again, but we are so thankful to you volunteers for going above and beyond to provide a magical guest experience and make our events so successful. We KNOW we have the best volunteer family in the world! The evening was filled with food, entertainment, prizes, ducks, bingo, and so much more! May 23, 2023 – John Mellencamp – Carol W. Went to the John Mellencamp concert and all we got were these silly armbands! LOL, for about 5 minutes we were fill-ins in the fourth row from the stage. May 26 – Beyond the Stage Awards Ceremony – Vinay T. We successfully concluded the first year of the Beyond the Stage program, which saw more than 20 CAPA students volunteer with the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust for a school year — with a final awards ceremony meeting where the students met with CEO Kendra Ingram. In total, the students committed 1456.583 hours as volunteers. That averages out to approximately 60 hours per student in just 8 months (Sept 2022 – May 2023). Students volunteered for over 60 different events at the Benedum, Byham, Liberty Magic, Art Galleries, Gallery Crawls, the Children’s Theater Festival, the Three Rivers Arts Festival, the Humanities Festival, and even the UPMC Rink at PPG Place! June 2, 2023 – KANSAS – Emily B. The team tonight did a really great job with the pre-show event. Everybody helping out (Diane, Rachel, Mary and Amanda) was extremely willing to roll with the punches and do whatever was needed to make the event happen. June 3, 2023 – Pride Festival Volunteers - Jonathan F. Just wanted to send along a huge thank you the volunteers: Kathleen, Mali, Dawn, Deb, Deb, & Dana. I leaned on them hard, it was busy, chaotic at times, and hot, and they were all smiles, helpful, and kind to all the festival goers. There’s no way this booth would have been successful without them – I hope they had a good time and felt valuable, because each of them were rockstars. Special shoutout to Deb B. for her staying from start to end – so grateful to her and her generous donation of her time and energy! June 2-11, 2023 – Dollar Bank Three Rivers Arts Festival - Vinay T. If I were to capture every single comment and moment I personally witnessed, along with everything you all reported to me, we'd have to publish a "TRAF Good News" book! We successfully gave away every single Dollar Bank tote bag, captured a lot of survey feedback, and so much more. Questions?

Ben Schonberger: Hi-NRG Pittsburgh 707 Gallery July 25, 2025 - February 22, 2026 Close Window Time Out You have exceeded the time limit and your seats have been released. Time left to complete order Ben Schonberger: Hi-NRG Skip to get tickets Ben Schonberger: Hi-NRG Fri, Jul 25 - Sun, Feb 22, 2026 Pittsburgh Cultural Trust 707 Gallery Ticket Prices Free Visual Arts Ben Schonberger is a Pittsburgh-based artist whose multidisciplinary practice examines the complexities of identity, power, and the archive. Through processes of appropriation and recombination, he recontextualizes found imagery to explore the intersection of personal and collective histories. This exhibition draws from the visual culture of the gay underground and the sonic legacy of Patrick Cowley, a pioneering composer and producer whose work helped define Hi-NRG (pronounced “high energy”)—an accelerated form of disco that emerged in the late 1970s. Before his death from AIDS in 1982, Cowley crafted some of the era’s most innovative electronic music, shaping a soundscape that pulsed through queer nightlife. For Hi-NRG, Schonberger constructed densely layered compositions sourced from vintage print media, merging representations of authority and sexuality. The works interrogate the shifting boundaries between power and desire, exploring how these forces converge within visual culture. At the center of the gallery, a vitrine displays brass knuckles cast in glass, evoking a tension between aggression and fragility, dominance and vulnerability. Reinterpreting a symbol of force through a material associated with transparency and breakability, these objects reflect the exhibition’s broader meditation on control, desire, and the ways in which systems of power are both historically inscribed and continually reimagined. About Ben Schonberger Ben Schonberger is an artist and educator based in Pittsburgh, PA. His multidisciplinary and layered practice investigates the complexities of identity through long-term social inquiries. His work explores themes of identity, the archive, and power, often using photography as a foundation for sculpture, installation, collage, and performance.

CAPA Gallery is open by appointment only. Call (412) 529-6101 to schedule your visit! In honor of the 45th anniversary of Pittsburgh’s Creative and Performing Arts School (CAPA), the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust is proud to present an exhibition of artwork recognizing the talents of CAPA faculty and alumni. Known for fostering creativity, innovation, and excellence, CAPA has shaped the artistic landscape of Pittsburgh for nearly half a century, inspiring countless young artists to pursue their passions and refine their crafts. This exhibition shows works that highlight the wide breadth of artistic talent that has emerged from this creative institution. From traditional fine art to innovative product design and documentary film, the selection reflects the expansive range of talent nurtured at CAPA. It underscores how public arts education fosters both artistic growth and real-world opportunity. While many CAPA alumni pursue careers beyond the arts, including in art-adjacent fields, an artistic sensibility developed in young adulthood remains a lifelong gift. When art fosters a shared sense of understanding, studying the arts becomes a lasting commitment to empathy, imagination, and curiosity - qualities that extend well beyond the classroom, as is evidenced by the works in this exhibition. This celebrates a long-standing tradition of artistic excellence and the dedication that has helped define Pittsburgh’s cultural identity. The exhibition stands as a testament to the transformative power of public arts education and the creative energy it inspires throughout our communities. Artists Featured in SPACE Gallery: 1.

Over his illustrious 60-year career, Zagaris has had unparallelled access to the players and his extensive portfolio includes coverage of 42 Super Bowls, 12 World Series, and 14 MLB All-Star Games.

He has photographed 42 Super Bowls, 12 World Series, and 14 MLB All-Star Games, earning three Super Bowl rings and one World Series ring.

Sharmistha Ray: Emergent Realties Pittsburgh Wood Street Galleries December 12, 2025 - July 5, 2026 Close Window Time Out You have exceeded the time limit and your seats have been released. Time left to complete order Sharmistha Ray: Emergent Realties Skip to get tickets Sharmistha Ray: Emergent Realties Fri, Dec 12 - Sun, Jul 5, 2026 Pittsburgh Cultural Trust Wood Street Galleries Ticket Prices Free Free Visual Arts Emergent Realities is newly commissioned three-channel animation by Sharmistha Ray that collages painting, original and found footage, and cosmic imagery into a layered visual odyssey. Spanning the ecological, cosmic, and psychological, the work collapses linear time into a simultaneous, immersive experience. Each channel operates both independently and in dialogue—projecting fragments of satellites drifting, comets arcing across space, painterly textures dissolving into stellar dust, and archival visions of the cosmos. By juxtaposing representations of deep time and human perception, the animation explores the simultaneity of cause and effect—not as a chain, but as a coexistent field. Solar flares ripple through painted abstractions; ecological collapse echoes in planetary drift; memory and future blur within the folds of light and motion. The viewer is drawn into a perceptual vortex where time loops, splinters, and converges. Complementing Ray’s animations is a newly commissioned musical score by Arooj Aftab, the Grammy-winning Pakistani-American composer, singer, and producer, celebrated for her genre-defying, deeply emotional music. Her signature voice has earned her recognition as the first Pakistani artist to win a Grammy, in the category of Best Global Music Performance and nominations for Best New Artist and global music performance. Emergent Realities invites the viewer to inhabit a temporal ecology—one in which every moment is simultaneously origin, consequence, and reflection, folded into the infinite continuity of space-time. About the artist Sharmistha Ray is the Estella Loomis McCandless Assistant Professor of Art at Carnegie Mellon University and a visual artist whose interdisciplinary practice explores the complexities of cultural inheritance and queer identity through abstraction in painting, drawing, sculpture, installation, and electronic media. In Emergent Realities Ray will present a new body of work featuring animations and sound. Ray has presented work in major exhibitions across the U.S., India, Mexico, and Brazil, and is the co-founder of Hilma’s Ghost, a spiritualist feminist art collective focused on collaborative research, pedagogy, and community engagement. Their work—both solo and collective—has been exhibited at institutions such as The Guggenheim Museum, New York; The Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum, Ridgefield, CT; Galería RGR, Mexico City, Mexico; The Museu de Arte de São Paulo, Brazil; and Secrist|Beach, Chicago, IL, and is featured in a major 2025 public art commission by the MTA at Grand Central Station, New York, NY. A recipient of the Joan Mitchell MFA Grant, Montblanc Young Artist Award, and TED Fellowship, Ray has held residencies at the Wassaic Project and Fire Island Artist Residency, among others, and has visited and taught at numerous institutions including Parsons School of Design, Rhode Island School of Design, School of the Art Institute of Chicago, and New York University. Their work has been reviewed in The New York Times, The Brooklyn Rail, Artnet, and Hyperallergic, and they currently serve on the Editorial Board of Feminist Art Practices and Research, a journal launched by Taylor & Francis in 2025. Ray holds an MFA and MS from Pratt Institute and a BA from Williams College. Sharmistha Ray: Emergent Realities is curated by Anastasia James and presented by the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust.

Ben Schonberger: Hi-NRG Pittsburgh 707 Gallery July 25, 2025 - February 22, 2026 Close Window Time Out You have exceeded the time limit and your seats have been released. Time left to complete order Ben Schonberger: Hi-NRG Skip to get tickets Ben Schonberger: Hi-NRG Fri, Jul 25 - Sun, Feb 22, 2026 Pittsburgh Cultural Trust 707 Gallery Ticket Prices Free Visual Arts Ben Schonberger is a Pittsburgh-based artist whose multidisciplinary practice examines the complexities of identity, power, and the archive. Through processes of appropriation and recombination, he recontextualizes found imagery to explore the intersection of personal and collective histories. This exhibition draws from the visual culture of the gay underground and the sonic legacy of Patrick Cowley, a pioneering composer and producer whose work helped define Hi-NRG (pronounced “high energy”)—an accelerated form of disco that emerged in the late 1970s. Before his death from AIDS in 1982, Cowley crafted some of the era’s most innovative electronic music, shaping a soundscape that pulsed through queer nightlife. For Hi-NRG, Schonberger constructed densely layered compositions sourced from vintage print media, merging representations of authority and sexuality. The works interrogate the shifting boundaries between power and desire, exploring how these forces converge within visual culture. At the center of the gallery, a vitrine displays brass knuckles cast in glass, evoking a tension between aggression and fragility, dominance and vulnerability. Reinterpreting a symbol of force through a material associated with transparency and breakability, these objects reflect the exhibition’s broader meditation on control, desire, and the ways in which systems of power are both historically inscribed and continually reimagined. About Ben Schonberger Ben Schonberger is an artist and educator based in Pittsburgh, PA. His multidisciplinary and layered practice investigates the complexities of identity through long-term social inquiries. His work explores themes of identity, the archive, and power, often using photography as a foundation for sculpture, installation, collage, and performance. Schonberger’s work has been exhibited nationally and internationally at prestigious institutions, including the Frankfurter Kunstverein, the Toledo Museum of Art, Aperture Gallery, the Phoenix Art Museum, VOX POPULI, Cranbrook Museum, and the North Carolina Museum of Art. He is the author of four books: Perfect Safety (2020), Detroit Shoreway (2017), HAMMER (2016), and Beautiful Pig (2014). His work is included in prominent institutional and private collections, such as the Toledo Museum of Art, the Detroit Institute of Arts, the New York Public Library, the Franklin Furnace Archive, and the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston Library. Schonberger is a member of the Associated Artists of Pittsburgh, The Aperture Foundation, and the Society for Photographic Education. He currently serves as Senior Lecturer in Photography and Program Coordinator for Media Arts at Point Park University, where he teaches courses on photography, experimental video, graphic design, and performance art. He earned his MFA in Photography from the Cranbrook Academy of Art in Bloomfield Hills, MI, and his BFA in Computer Imagery and Photography from Shepherd University in Shepherdstown, WV.

CAPA Gallery is open by appointment only. Call (412) 529-6101 to schedule your visit! In honor of the 45th anniversary of Pittsburgh’s Creative and Performing Arts School (CAPA), the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust is proud to present an exhibition of artwork recognizing the talents of CAPA faculty and alumni. Known for fostering creativity, innovation, and excellence, CAPA has shaped the artistic landscape of Pittsburgh for nearly half a century, inspiring countless young artists to pursue their passions and refine their crafts. This exhibition shows works that highlight the wide breadth of artistic talent that has emerged from this creative institution. From traditional fine art to innovative product design and documentary film, the selection reflects the expansive range of talent nurtured at CAPA. It underscores how public arts education fosters both artistic growth and real-world opportunity. While many CAPA alumni pursue careers beyond the arts, including in art-adjacent fields, an artistic sensibility developed in young adulthood remains a lifelong gift. When art fosters a shared sense of understanding, studying the arts becomes a lasting commitment to empathy, imagination, and curiosity - qualities that extend well beyond the classroom, as is evidenced by the works in this exhibition. This celebrates a long-standing tradition of artistic excellence and the dedication that has helped define Pittsburgh’s cultural identity. The exhibition stands as a testament to the transformative power of public arts education and the creative energy it inspires throughout our communities. Artists Featured in SPACE Gallery: 1.

Get Tickets MICHIYAYA Dance in partnership with the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust Wood Street Galleries Ballet & Dance Visual Arts Road to Sky is an immersive multimedia dance experience by MICHIYAYA Dance, created by Artistic Directors Anya and Mitsuko Clarke-Verdery. This powerful work dives deep into the raw and transformative journey of queer parenthood—centered on Anya’s experience as the birthing parent and Mitsuko’s as the supporting partner. Set across two rooms, Road to Sky shatters traditional narratives, pulling audiences into the intimate and emotional landscape of a queer birth story. Anya and Mitsuko chart their path to parenthood—not as a straight line, but as a winding, reflective road paved with intention, vulnerability, and fierce love. Road to Sky is a deeply personal yet universally resonant work that reclaims space, honors choice, and reimagines what family can look like. Road to Sky is made possible by the New York State Council on the Arts with the support of the Office of the Governor and the New York State Legislature; as well as the Tomayko Foundation, and the Opportunity Fund.

Sharmistha Ray: Emergent Realties Pittsburgh Wood Street Galleries December 12, 2025 - July 5, 2026 Close Window Time Out You have exceeded the time limit and your seats have been released. Time left to complete order Sharmistha Ray: Emergent Realties Skip to get tickets Sharmistha Ray: Emergent Realties Fri, Dec 12 - Sun, Jul 5, 2026 Pittsburgh Cultural Trust Wood Street Galleries Ticket Prices Free Free Visual Arts Emergent Realities is newly commissioned three-channel animation by Sharmistha Ray that collages painting, original and found footage, and cosmic imagery into a layered visual odyssey. Spanning the ecological, cosmic, and psychological, the work collapses linear time into a simultaneous, immersive experience. Each channel operates both independently and in dialogue—projecting fragments of satellites drifting, comets arcing across space, painterly textures dissolving into stellar dust, and archival visions of the cosmos. By juxtaposing representations of deep time and human perception, the animation explores the simultaneity of cause and effect—not as a chain, but as a coexistent field. Solar flares ripple through painted abstractions; ecological collapse echoes in planetary drift; memory and future blur within the folds of light and motion. The viewer is drawn into a perceptual vortex where time loops, splinters, and converges. Complementing Ray’s animations is a newly commissioned musical score by Arooj Aftab, the Grammy-winning Pakistani-American composer, singer, and producer, celebrated for her genre-defying, deeply emotional music. Her signature voice has earned her recognition as the first Pakistani artist to win a Grammy, in the category of Best Global Music Performance and nominations for Best New Artist and global music performance. Emergent Realities invites the viewer to inhabit a temporal ecology—one in which every moment is simultaneously origin, consequence, and reflection, folded into the infinite continuity of space-time. About the artist Sharmistha Ray is the Estella Loomis McCandless Assistant Professor of Art at Carnegie Mellon University and a visual artist whose interdisciplinary practice explores the complexities of cultural inheritance and queer identity through abstraction in painting, drawing, sculpture, installation, and electronic media. In Emergent Realities Ray will present a new body of work featuring animations and sound. Ray has presented work in major exhibitions across the U.S., India, Mexico, and Brazil, and is the co-founder of Hilma’s Ghost, a spiritualist feminist art collective focused on collaborative research, pedagogy, and community engagement. Their work—both solo and collective—has been exhibited at institutions such as The Guggenheim Museum, New York; The Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum, Ridgefield, CT; Galería RGR, Mexico City, Mexico; The Museu de Arte de São Paulo, Brazil; and Secrist|Beach, Chicago, IL, and is featured in a major 2025 public art commission by the MTA at Grand Central Station, New York, NY. A recipient of the Joan Mitchell MFA Grant, Montblanc Young Artist Award, and TED Fellowship, Ray has held residencies at the Wassaic Project and Fire Island Artist Residency, among others, and has visited and taught at numerous institutions including Parsons School of Design, Rhode Island School of Design, School of the Art Institute of Chicago, and New York University. Their work has been reviewed in The New York Times, The Brooklyn Rail, Artnet, and Hyperallergic, and they currently serve on the Editorial Board of Feminist Art Practices and Research, a journal launched by Taylor & Francis in 2025. Ray holds an MFA and MS from Pratt Institute and a BA from Williams College. Sharmistha Ray: Emergent Realities is curated by Anastasia James and presented by the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust.

Fountain and Eye Benches Close Window Time Out You have exceeded the time limit and your seats have been released. Time left to complete order Fountain and Eye Benches Louise Bourgeois, 1999 Agnes R. Katz Plaza, a landmark public space in downtown Pittsburgh’s Cultural District, features the largest public art commission by internationally celebrated artist Louise Bourgeois. At its center stands Fountain , a 25-foot bronze sculpture whose rising, spiraling form echoes the city’s dramatic topography. Surrounding the plaza are three granite Eye Benches , functional sculptural works that merge Bourgeois’s recurring motifs with a human-scale invitation to pause and observe. Together, the works transform the 23,000-square-foot plaza into a contemplative urban oasis. The commission was realized through a rare and thoughtful collaboration between Bourgeois; renowned landscape architect Daniel Urban Kiley; architect Michael Graves, designer of the adjacent Theater Square; and the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust. The opening of Katz Plaza in 1999 coincided with a major solo presentation of Bourgeois’s work at Wood Street Galleries, marking a significant moment of recognition for the artist in Pittsburgh. The plaza was named in loving memory of Agnes R. Katz through a generous gift from her children and remains one of the city’s most iconic public spaces. About the Artist Louise Bourgeois (1911–2010) was a pioneering figure in modern and contemporary art, known for her psychologically charged sculptures, installations, and works on paper. Born in France and based in New York for most of her life, Bourgeois explored themes of memory, trauma, the body, and domesticity with remarkable emotional depth and formal innovation. Her work has been exhibited worldwide, including major retrospectives at the Museum of Modern Art, the Tate Modern, and the Centre Pompidou. In 2007, she represented the United States at the Venice Biennale. Bourgeois’s public artworks, including Fountain , the Eye Benches , and the monumental Maman , continue to resonate globally for their profound symbolism and striking presence.

Mural Close Window Time Out You have exceeded the time limit and your seats have been released. Time left to complete order Mural Richard Haas, 1993 In 1993, the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust commissioned renowned American muralist Richard Haas to create a striking homage to Pittsburgh’s historic steel industry. Located on the Fort Duquesne Boulevard façade of the Byham Theater, the mural exemplifies Haas’s mastery of trompe l’oeil —a technique that employs highly realistic imagery to create the optical illusion of three-dimensional architectural elements on a flat surface. Haas’s design ingeniously incorporates the theater’s existing doors and windows, seamlessly blending painted details with real architectural features to produce a dynamic and immersive visual experience. Reflecting on the complexity of the project in a Pittsburgh Post-Gazette interview, Haas described the mural as "one of the most complicated façades I've done," underscoring the technical and artistic challenges involved in transforming the theater’s façade into a monumental work of public art. About the Artist Richard Haas (b. 1936, New York, NY) is a pioneering figure in the field of architectural muralism, celebrated for his large-scale trompe l’oeil paintings that transform urban environments. Since the 1960s, Haas has created murals across the United States and internationally, redefining architectural façades with illusions that engage viewers in a playful dialogue between reality and representation. His work can be found on buildings in cities such as New York, Chicago, and Boston, and has been featured in exhibitions at the Smithsonian American Art Museum and the Museum of Modern Art. Haas’s murals celebrate architectural history, urban identity, and the possibilities of public art to enliven cityscapes. Visit Join Our Newsletter! Learn More
