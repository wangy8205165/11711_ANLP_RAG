Steelers Alumni Legends | Pittsburgh Steelers - Steelers.com Skip to main content Steelers Alumni Legends | Pittsburgh Steelers - Steelers.com Steelers Legends Community More than 1,700 players have worn the Black and Gold since the team was founded in 1933. Steelers players of the past paved the way for the Steelers of today and the future. The Legends Community was created by the NFL to celebrate, embrace, educate and connect all who have played in the League. A Legend is defined as a "person or thing that inspires." With less than 1 percent of high school football players eventually being drafted by an NFL team, Commissioner Roger Goodell defined an NFL Legend as anyone who "signed a contract and played at least one preseason game. Once a Player, Always a Legend." We celebrate our Steelers Legends. Many of them remain active in business and the community, and quite a few have made Pittsburgh their home. Once a Steeler, Always a Steeler. Visit this page to see what our Legends are doing now, as well as learn more about those who came before.

This program is finding ways to support females, drive them to the top, and keep them climbing.â 2024 Honorees Stories Like Me Helen Campbell / Co-Owner and CEO Helen Campbell (she/her) and Imogen Campbell Hendricks (she/her) - co-owners, business partners, and mom and daughter team - are thrilled to be selected as Women of Steel.

Fierce Knockouts Karin Christoff / Owner Karin, a proud mother of two teenage boys and married to a fellow veteran, brings a unique journey to her business. Originally from Peru, she arrived in the U.S. with no English skills but, through much sacrifice, learned by attending night school. She served as a U.S. Army soldier and was deployed to Afghanistan. She earned her bachelor's in information technology and MBA after she was honorably discharged from active duty. Inspired by her personal experiences during the pandemic, Karin founded Fierce Knockouts to address a gap in workout apparel for women. She recognized that many women gain weight around their midsection, yet most clothes are designed for an ideal body shape. By creating beautiful, confidence-boosting workout clothes, Karin aims to make busy women feel amazing whether they're working out, running errands, or doing chores at home. Her mission is to empower and uplift women, one outfit at a time. Mele's Gifts & Party Planning Jarmele E. Fairclaugh / Gift Creator & Owner Founded in 2019 by Gift Creator and Owner Jarmele E. Fairclaugh, Mele's Gifts & Party Planning emerged from a deeply personal journey. What began as a heartfelt tradition of creating custom gifts for Jarmele's beloved grandmother, who resided in a nursing facility, has grown into a thriving business dedicated to celebrating life's special moments. Jarmele's mission started with simple acts of loveâgift-wrapping chocolates, clothing, and shoes to bring a smile to her grandmother's face. Her grandmother, a cherished beacon of joy and strength in the family following the passing of Jarmele's mother, inspired the creation of Mele's Gifts & Party Planning. Following her grandmother's passing, Jarmele's familyâher son Michael and husband Markâencouraged her to turn her passion into a business. They established a website and business cards, and with their support, Mele's Gifts & Party Planning was born. Today, Mele's Gifts & Party Planning is proud to be part of a vibrant community of woman-owned businesses and is honored to be recognized as a Woman of Steel by the Pittsburgh Steelers and PNC Bank. We specialize in custom-created gifts and exceptional event planning, dedicated to turning your ideas into reality and making every occasion memorable.

The Colombian Spot Karen Perdomo / Owner Karen Perdomo, a Colombian and New Jersey native, with a background in school business administration, opened The Colombian Spot, a family business, in the former Pittsburgh Public Market in October of 2015 introducing Arepas in the city of Pittsburgh for the first time. Starting as a small business with a limited space and a limited menu, it grew into a full service restaurant in the South Side neighborhood and ever since, this has been the Latin spot for many families in a time where Latin American restaurants were non-existent in the city . Later in 2022, a second location opened in the Oakland area near Pitt campus offering take out options for students and professionals. While Empanadas and Arepas are the signature items on the menu, The Colombian Spot offers a diverse Latin American fusion menu, and catering services. Karen's leadership, strategy, organization, discipline, and vision for the business, has developed many growing opportunities, including catering services for corporate and professional baseball teams, as well as community affiliations with Latin organizations and other local neighborhood organizations.

Steelers in Ireland | Pittsburgh Steelers - Steelers.com Skip to main content Steelers in Ireland | Pittsburgh Steelers - Steelers.com Steelers Roots in Ireland The Pittsburgh Steelers will play their first ever regular season game at Croke Park in Dublin in 2025, as part of expanding their footprint into Ireland. The Steelers and Ireland have a deep-rooted connection. Read more >>> The Rooney family emigrated from the town of Newry in Northern Ireland to the United States in the 19th century, where the family ultimately settled in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Dan Rooney joined forces with Pittsburgh businessman Anthony J.F. O'Reilly to create The Ireland Fund in 1976, which merged with the American Irish Foundation to create the American Ireland Funds, a leading charitable organization benefiting Ireland. Dan Rooney's love of Ireland also fueled a passion to bring an NFL game to Ireland, a that dream became a reality when the Steelers took on the Chicago Bears in a preseason game in 1997 at Croke Park. Dan Rooney was asked to serve as United States Ambassador to Ireland by President Barack Obama, a role he cherished from 2009-2012. While in Ireland serving as Ambassador, Rooney visited all 32 counties on the island, meeting with politicians, media, business leaders and citizens. The Pittsburgh Steelers were awarded rights to expand their brand and activities for the Republic of Ireland & Northern Ireland, as part of the NFL's 'Global Markets Program', on May 23, 2023. The Pittsburgh Steelers hosted their first-ever Watch Party at Croke Park in Dublin, Ireland, during Week 11 against the Cleveland Browns, on Sunday, Nov. 19, 2023.

Nominate Now Frequently Asked Questions About the Steelers, Ireland & the NFL's 'Global Markets Program' What is the NFL’s ‘Global Markets Program’? The 'Global Markets Program', which launched in January 2022 as the International Home Marketing Areas (IHMA), grants NFL clubs access to international markets for marketing, fan engagement and commercialization activations as part of an important, long-term strategic effort to enable clubs to build their brands globally while driving NFL fan growth beyond the US. NFL clubs can apply for rights to selected international markets by submitting proposals for the International Committee to review each Spring. Clubs are awarded rights for at least a five-year term through the program. During this period, a club has the rights to pursue activities in that international market that are consistent with what they can do in their home market. Why did the Steelers apply for a ‘Global Markets Programs’ license in Ireland? There are a number of reasons why the Steelers decided to make this initiative across the Island of Ireland a priority. The Rooney family emigrated from Ireland in the 1840s and their Irish roots have remained important to them. Current Steelers President Art Rooney II became the first member of the Rooney Family to visit Northern Ireland since the family emigrated in 1840 when he visited there in the early 1970s. Former Steelers Chairman Dan Rooney and his wife, Patricia, spent a great deal of their time giving back to Ireland and worked hard to help make it a better place, whether that be through establishing The Ireland Funds or his work as the U.S. Ambassador to Ireland. He also drove the decision to play an NFL game in Ireland in 1997. Mrs. Patricia Rooney, whose family emigrated from County Mayo in the 1920s, was a guiding force in the establishment of the Rooney Prize for Irish Literature. When the NFL created the opportunity for all teams to become active in international markets, Ireland was on the team's short list. This license will enable the Steelers to bring back some of the traditions and initiatives instituted by Dan Rooney, as well as to bring some new ones forward. What does this mean for Ireland? The NFL's 'Global Markets Program' allows the Steelers to be active across the island of Ireland. Over the coming year, the Steelers plan to re-launch an initiative started by Dan Rooney years ago, flag football. Flag is a part of the team's overall international strategy and is easy to play for young people of all ages. The Steelers also plan to enact other events, including watch parties and other football education experiences. The team is roughly two years into its NFL's 'Global Markets Program' in Mexico, and in that time, has held several in-market draft celebrations, a kicking clinic for both professional football players as well as young people, a pair of youth flag events, a large-scale watch party in Mexico City, as well as a business summit with members of the business community. We'll look to bring similar initiatives to Ireland; and plan to be thoughtful and intentional about how they are introduced. Will the Steelers bring players to Ireland? The Steelers plan is to host events and activities in Ireland that will engage fans and current and former players are a part of that strategy.

Winning while building Skip to main content Advertising Winning while building Oct 04, 2025 at 09:00 AM Jim Wexell Correspondent Copied! Winning while building. That's a view of the Steelers season after four games. It's both apt and optimistic for a 3-1 team that saw a 50 percent turnover of the players (who comprised the top 13 amount of snaps on both sides of the ball) in the 2024 and 2025 openers. Fifty percent turnover is a massive change. And the turnover from 2024 playoff lineup to 2025 opener was 38 percent, still a sizable turnover. For a coach whose goal of the preseason was to get his players to "the starting line" in good health, the building -- the true team building -- didn't begin until the regular season did. And the Steelers have obviously improved from Week One to Week Four, when the sizable import of new players began to settle in. The Steelers entered their bye week at 3-1 with road wins against two AFC opponents. The fact they rank 29th in offense and 28th in defense offers promise that so much improvement is yet to occur. How did they do it? Well, their "turnover culture" is alive and well. The Steelers are second in the NFL with a +7 margin in turnovers, much of that due to a third-place standing in total sacks with 14. They are also seventh in red zone TD percentage, so they not only get extra chances with turnovers, they take advantage with touchdowns. Individually, only Aaron Rodgers has a top-10 spot in key rankings. The Steelers' new QB is fourth with 8 TD passes and ninth with a 102.6 passer rating. But statistics don't tell the story of "winning while building" at 3-1. The highlights have kept Steelers Nation on the edge of its collective seat throughout the first quarter of the season. Here's a game-by-game look at the best of the first four games: Steelers 34, Jets 32 - First TD of the season a play-action, roll right pass from Rodgers to a wide open Ben Skowronek. - Chris Boswell kicked field goals of 56 and a team-record 60 yards, the latter turning out to be the game-winner with 1:03 remaining. - On a late-game fourth-and-3 for the Jets, Steelers cornerback Jalen Ramsey drilled Jets wide receiver Garrett Wilson to jar the ball loose and seal the Steelers' win.

Irish eyes were smiling Skip to main content Advertising Irish eyes were smiling Oct 03, 2025 at 06:00 PM Mike Prisuta Steelers.com Copied! As they were from Austria, Germany, Hungary, Sweden, England and Brazil, to name just a few among numerous other exotic points of origin represented in Ireland for the spectacle that was Steelers-Vikings last Sunday. As anticipated, most were Steelers fans. What was surprising was how many were there for the game, not necessarily Terrible Towel waving or "Renegade" or anything else that had more to do with entertainment and fan engagement than it did the actual playing of American football. One Brazilian, in particular, betrayed the depth of understanding and knowledge of the game many Steelers fans from all over the world brought with them to the Emerald Isle, even those who showed up despite not in possession of tickets. "They need to invest more in the offensive line." He was reminded offensive tackles Broderick Jones and Troy Fautanu are both former first-round picks and center Zach Frazier is a former second-round selection, but was still not deterred. The boys from Brazil would like to focus on the continued development of the offensive line, and that wasn't the only time such nuance and detail were passionately discussed in an overflowing pub where someone was singing Cranberries songs and the decor included a "John F. Kennedy for President" poster from 1960 on one wall and a bronze representation of James Joyce in front of another. Welcome to Dublin. âââ This wasn't, after further review, where the streets had no name. And the names were all recognizable to the Steelers fans crowding up and down the cobblestones of the Temple Bar district, touring the Guinness Storehouse or visiting Christ Church Cathedral, Trinity College or any of the numerous other local attractions. The nameplates and numbers on the backs of authentic jerseys were omnipresent. "Roethlisberger 7," and "Bettis 36" and "Greene 75" and "Russell 34," to name just a few; almost every era of Steelers football, it seemed, was on display. And it wasn't just fans celebrating their favorite players. A host of former Steelers were there in the flesh. The group included Bettis, Mark Bruener, James Farrior, Brett Keisel, Carnell Lake, Maurice Pouncey, Roethlisberger, John Stallworth, Max Starks and Ike Taylor. They enthusiastically showed up for events such as football camps (including one in Belfast, Northern Ireland), Q&A's at Fitzsimons Pub, a flag football event at the U.S. Ambassador's residence and a tailgate. The ex-players sampled a pint or two and served as good will ambassadors throughout. They didn't want to miss this, either. Fitzsimons served as an unofficial headquarters for Steelers fans and hosted broadcasts on Steelers Nation Radio and WDVE-FM in Pittsburgh, the flagship station on the Steelers Audio Network, and Steelers fans responded. According to Romy Carroll, manager of sales and marketing for Fitzsimons, business was up about 50 percent over an average weekend and surpassed annual events such as St. Patrick's Day and the All-Ireland Finals for rugby and Gaelic football (which draw sellout crowds to Croke Park, the venue for the Steelers-Vikings game) in terms of attendance and, perhaps, merriment. "We are known as the biggest and best live entertainment venue in Temple Bar and have been nominated for many awards, including 'The Best Live Entertainment Venue' in Dublin," Carroll explained. "But this weekend the award has to go to the outstanding Steelers fans who came over to Ireland in droves because of the passion they have for Pittsburgh, the love of the game and most of all the historic Irish connection the Steelers have to our country." Did anyone expect anything less? "It just shows the support that Steelers Nation gets, from not only the crowds but the former players," maintained Bruener, a former tight end, a current scout for the Steelers and the father of rookie Steelers linebacker Carson Bruener. "It also shows how the players are treated by the organization, by the Rooney family. You could probably poll a lot of players that have played for a lot of different (Steelers) teams and I think the common comments that you're going to get from former players is the way they're treated by the Rooney family. "This is a tough business, let's be clear, but you can still treat people the right way. And former players, if they played with us for a year or they played with us for a decade, they all have the same type of sentiments toward the team and the way they're treated by the team. And that allegiance carries over to a game like this here in Ireland." Bruener was asked if the Steelers reach out to alumni in situations such as the historic Ireland trip. "I think it was more (the former players) saying, 'Please, can I come? And is there anything I can do?' That's the way we are, the way the Steeler family is." Added Pouncey: "I'm beyond grateful. The people here, the hospitality, this has been beyond a blessing for us." âââ For this writer, and some others, the journey across the pond started in, of all places, Cleveland. Direct flights on Aer Lingus bound for Dublin were available at Cleveland Hopkins International Airport and many western Pennsylvanians took full advantage. No wonder an exasperated bartender at one of the Hopkins' establishments wondered aloud, "Why is everyone in here wearing a Steelers jersey?" There were fans from all over the world at the game, especially the host nation. But there was an atypical number of Steelers fans in attendance for such an NFL event, fans whose next game is as likely to be at Acrisure Stadium as anywhere else. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell detailed the departure from the norm in an interview with sideline reporter Missi Matthews on the Steelers Audio Network Pregame Show. For international games, "We normally have most of our fans coming from the country that we're playing in, and that's why we're playing it," Goodell maintained. "This game is different. I think one-third of the crowd here today came from the (United) States, and I think it'll be pretty Steeler-heavy. "I'm not surprised, they travel better than any team in the NFL, probably." He wasn't wrong, either. In what was officially a home game for the Steelers, the Steelers' crowd took over at Croke Park. The Vikings were the team that had to resort with regularity to the silent count (although the Steelers had to on occasion, as well, such was the level of exuberance). And the Steelers played, not a complete game but one that was much more in tune with what they've been after all along than what they'd been able to muster in the season's first three weeks. They may have let a 24-6, fourth-quarter lead dwindle to three, the game may have come down to one final defensive stop and ended up being "a little more entertaining than maybe it should have been," as head coach Mike Tomlin acknowledged. But in the end it was a beautiful day. They found much if not all of what they're looking for. Re-Joyce. Sometimes, the longest way 'round really is the shortest way home.

A week to remember on the Emerald Isle Skip to main content Advertising A week to remember on the Emerald Isle The Steelers visit to the island of Ireland in Week 4 was certainly one to remember By Teresa Varley Oct 03, 2025 Irish eyes were smiling on the Steelers when they played in the first ever NFL regular season game in Ireland, defeating the Minnesota Vikings, 24-21, in front of 74,512 fans at Dublin's historic Croke Park. The organization was active across the island throughout the week: The Terrible Towel Tour Former Steelers lineman and Steelers Audio Network Color Analyst Max Starks traveled around the island of Ireland delivering Terrible Towels, in partnership with Aer Lingus. Starting in Dublin, Starks made stops across the south, west and north, visiting some well-known sites, as well as some not-so-well known, culminating the four-day journey in Belfast. The trip was documented on the Steelers Irish social media channels and stops included: Limerick, Kilkenny, the Cliffs of Moher and Derry! A Trip North On Thursday, members of the organization traveled from Dublin to Northern Ireland, where The Ireland Funds and Steelers announced the establishment of the Dan and Patricia Rooney No Mind Left Behind Scholarship. Dan Rooney Sr., along with Pittsburgh businessman Tony O'Reilly, founded The Ireland Funds and the organization wanted to find a way to honor him and his wife, Patricia. The scholarship was announced during an event in Newry, County Down, where Dan Rooney Sr.'s family ancestry is deeply rooted and is an area that he always held close to his heart. Steelers Vice President of Business Development & Strategy Dan Rooney and Ireland Funds President Caitriona Fottrell awarded scholarships to two college-bound students from Newry as well as announced donations of $10,000 to each of their schools. Earlier that day, the team hosted a free American Flag Football Clinics, presented by Aer Lingus and UPMC, in Belfast for 100 local young boys and girls. The clinic was conducted by Steelers legends Jerome Bettis, Max Starks and Ike Taylor. Karl Roser/Pittsburgh Steelers The Team Arrives The Steelers departed from Pittsburgh on Thursday evening via an Aer Lingus flight from Pittsburgh International Airport and landed in Dublin on Friday. Later that day, the team held a practice at Carton House, which was covered by approximately 100 media members from around the globe. While practicing, the players wore special jerseys with their names translated from English to Gaelic, done by Aedin Ni Bhrianin, the Irish Language Development Officer for Munster Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA). The idea for the practice jerseys originated with Steelers equipment manager Adam Regan, who presented it to team President Art Rooney II and Vice President of Business Development & Strategy Dan Rooney. Fitzsimons Pub: Home Away From Home One of Dublin's most historic pubs turned into homebase for Steelers Nation over the course of game weekend. Fitzsimons Pub, located in Temple Bar, literally became part of Steelers Country â with branding on both the inside and outside of the pub. Live entertainment included Irish music, as well as 8+ hours a day of live Steelers audio programming, including SNR Drive & The WDVE Morning Show, emanating from the top floor of the pub each day. Fans were also treated to alumni appearances, including one by Maurkice Pouncey, who poured his own pint from behind the bar! Over a three day period, over 3,000 fans visited Fitzsimmons. "We normally have strong weekends when it comes to the All-Ireland Finals, Irish Rugby, Irish Football, New Years Eve & even St. Patrick's weekend, which is normally our strongest weekend every year," said Romy Carroll, the pub's Sales & Marketing Manager. "But we've never seen anything like the crowds of supporters and fans that the Steelers bought in to Fitzsimons over the weekend." Fan Tailgate in Merrion Square Park From Friday through Sunday, the FÃ¡ilte Steelers Tailgate, presented by Aer Lingus, provided a place for Steelers fans to gather in the heart of Dublin's City Centre in picturesque Merrion Square Park. Over the course of the three days, over 20,000 Steelers fans attended the free event and enjoyed food and beverage, live music and entertainment, lawn games, video programming and much more. The weekend kicked off with a bang as those in attendance were treated to a Q&A session with Legends Ben Roethlisberger, Maurkice Pouncey and Ike Taylor. Saturday included performances from lrish dancers, a live band and more alumni appearances from Max Starks and James Farrior. Sunday provided a place for fans to watch the game for free on two large video screens. The Tailgate also featured American football youth flag clinics, presented by Aer Lingus & UPMC. Over the course of three days, over 200 young people got coaching tips from Steelers Legends. A Visit To The Ambassador's Residence The NFL hosted a flag football event at the U.S. Ambassador to Ireland's residence in Phoenix Park on Saturday, an opportunity for approximately 40 youth from area schools to take part in a five-on-five NFL Flag Football Tournament. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, Steelers President Art Rooney II and Steelers Vice President of Business Development & Strategy Dan Rooney were in attendance for the fun-filled afternoon, which included gift exchanges with U.S. Ambassador to Ireland Edward Walsh. Ben Roethlisberger, Maurkice Pouncey and Ike Taylor were all on hand to provide instruction and encouragement for the youth. Town Hall Forum & Pittsburgh Reception Later in the day on Saturday, Art Rooney II and Jerome Bettis spoke as part of a panel at NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell's Town Hall. The Town Hall, an event the commissioner normally hosts at NFL International events, hit on a wide range of topics, from the growing global market to fan support in cities around the globe, and everything in between. Meanwhile, Steelers Vice President of Business Development and Strategy Dan Rooney also spoke at The Pittsburgh Reception, an event celebrating the economic and cultural partnership between Ireland and the Pittsburgh region. Steelers Pro Shop Ireland The Steelers opened an official retail location in Dublin earlier in the month of September and while business was brisk in the first few weeks, game week saw the official Steelers Pro Shop in Ireland attract shoppers by the thousands. Steelers Nation from around the world stopped to check out the Ireland collection, as did Steelers President Art Rooney II and NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell. In addition, Jerome Bettis surprised shoppers by stopping in on the Friday of game week to meet fans and sign autographs. Game Day On Sunday, one of Europe's largest and most historic stadiums turned into a sea of Black & Gold. Steelers fans from all over the world showed out at Croke Park to support the team, with Terrible Towels on full display throughout the day. The Terrible Towel Twirl was led by Ben Roethlisberger, Jerome Bettis and renowned Irish athletes Stephanie Roche and Paudie Clifford. The pregame sequence also featured the unfurling of a giant Terrible Towel in the stands. The game was full of memorable plays and finished off with the Steelers securing a memorable win.

Martin: 'He can do everything' Skip to main content Advertising Martin: 'He can do everything' Oct 02, 2025 at 04:40 PM Jim Wexell Correspondent Copied! At the quarter mark of the regular season, the Steelers, with their 14 sacks, trail the NFL's league leader by one, and in fact are on an early pace to set a team record for sacks in a season. It probably helps that the Steelers have three big-time edge-rushers in a two-edge world. "With the production we get out of those three guys," said OLBs coach Denzel Martin, "yeah, that's three starters." Nick Herbig has for two seasons been a super-sub behind T.J. Watt and Alex Highsmith. Herbig had 3 sacks as a rookie and then 5.5 sacks last season. But in only two-plus games in relief of the injured Highsmith, Herbig has stepped in like Lou Gehrig and been a force. To wit: T.J. Watt, in 238 snaps, has 3 sacks. 5 tackles-for-loss, 6 QB hits, an interception, forced fumble, and fumble recovery. Classic All-Pro stuff from T.J. Herbig, in 178 snaps, has 2.5 sacks, 4 tackles-for-loss, 8 QB hits, an interception and forced fumble. Classic Steelers dual-edge numbers. And the return of Highsmith will make it a three-edge world. "Very, very excited," Martin said. "Just want to get all those dudes together. That's why we got them all, so we can have all four together. It's gonna be good stuff for us." Oh, and rookie Jack Sawyer makes a fourth viable edge-rusher. In 14 snaps, Sawyer has a sack, 2 tackles-for-loss, and ranks second among the team's edge-rushers with 14 tackles, only 5 behind Watt in 223 fewer snaps. It's almost as if Sawyer's soaking up the atmosphere around here. "We enjoy having the four, the Full Metal Jacket," Martin said. "Getting them all going will be nice, for real." Herbig missed the opener, but in the 10 snaps that Martin had his "Full Metal Jacket" available, he used the "three starters" on the field altogether on third-down passing situations. Nothing landed, but the blueprint was drawn. But then Highsmith went down in the second quarter of Week Two with an ankle injury. In stepped Herbig, who intercepted a fourth-and-1 pass (off a Cam Heyward deflection) that game. The next week, during a 14-14 tie game at New England, Herbig's fourth-quarter strip-sack, on a Patriots first-down play at the Pittsburgh 33, was recovered by Watt to set the Steelers up for their game-winning drive. Against the Vikings in Dublin, Herbig's third-and-12 sack in the second quarter set up Aaron Rodgers' 80-yard TD pass to DK Metcalf that sent the Steelers off and running. To seal the win, Herbig pressured QB Carson Wentz into an intentional grounding penalty that lost 16 yards (and 10 seconds). The Vikings couldn't recover from second-and-26 and the Steelers improved to 3-1. "Nick's a good football player. That's just what he is. He can do everything," Martin said. "People like to think he's just a pass guy, but if you watch the tape from this past week, he was (defending) run, pass, anything we needed him to be â special teams, you know what I mean? He just does it all. He's just gonna continue to get better every week." At 240 pounds, Herbig's game is based more off quickness than size. But according to Martin â who took over the OLB coaching position the same year Herbig was drafted â Herbig's run defense has improved significantly. Martin was asked how that development occurred. "Just the constant stuff we do in individual every day," Martin said. "We're on the sleds, putting our hands on people, using our hands, releasing off people, and making plays. I just think he continually does that each week and he puts it on tape." Watt and Herbig, both from the University of Wisconsin, have 5.5 of the Steelers' 14 sacks. Extrapolated out over 17 games, those 14 sacks would become 59.5, enough to break the team record of 56 set in both the 2017 and 2020 seasons that were 16 games in length. The "Blitzburgh" defense of 1994 had 55 sacks. "We just like to get after the passer," Martin said. "Blitzes sometimes get us our one-on-ones and the things that we want and help us get to the passer easier. "It's all exciting. That's Blitzburgh. That's what I've known since I've been here. And we just want to keep going."

An unselfish group Skip to main content Advertising An unselfish group Oct 02, 2025 at 04:00 PM Teresa Varley Steelers.com Copied! Steelers fans saw on Sunday what DK Metcalf brings to the offense when he broke loose for an 80-yard touchdown reception against the Minnesota Vikings, speeding down the sidelines for the score. Receivers coach Zach Azzanni jokingly said he would like to take credit for Metcalf's yards after catch because they put so much focus on it every practice, but he said it was all Metcalf. "We work on it a lot. We emphasize it a lot, every drill that we do, every route," said Azzanni. "I show film of it throughout the week, of other teams, of us. We talk about all of that. "I would love to tell you that DK was all coaching, but that one, it was him. I got a lot teasing about that. But we do coach it, we emphasize it just like everyone else in the league does it, but those guys make it breathe." And what Metcalf has brought to the offense, in the words of Azzanni is a breath of fresh air. Metcalf, who was acquired in a trade with the Seattle Seahawks this offseason, has a business-like approach to the game, wanting nothing more than to win every week. "It's been a pleasure," said Azzanni of working with Metcalf. "It's a breath of fresh air. He's great to work with. He's a true pro. He does anything you ask him to do. He's a team guy, which is really cool. "He gets as excited when other guys make plays as he does when he makes a play. And when you have a room like that with a lot of guys and your bell cow is wired like that, it's a pleasure to coach. "It's fun to go in the meeting room. No one's too prideful to take corrections. So, it's been a really good addition having him there." It's an attitude Azzanni said permeates not just with Metcalf, but throughout the entire receiver room, including Calvin Austin III, Roman Wilson, Scotty Miller and Ben Skowronek. And their performance reflects that. "These guys are just doing what they're asked to do, which is cool," said Azzanni. "The goal is to win football games. If they block 40 times, they block 40 times We throw 40 times, we throw 40 and none of them say a word. "They're a very unselfish group. It's a really good room. So, I feel good about where they are." Another player who epitomizes that unselfish approach is Skowronek. He might not get the numbers in the receiving game, but he contributes in ways that are hard to measure. "Ben's the kind of guy that you don't want on other teams," said Azzanni. "You like it on your team. He's a guy that does all the dirty work. He is the goon, if you will. And he is a sneaky good receiver too. "He is a talented kid. People don't give him enough credit for that because of the other things that he does so well on special teams and carrying the run fight for us. But he's also a very talented receiver, which he proved in college. "He's great. He is a big personality. He's fun to have in the room. "Between him and DK going at each other in fun and playful ways. It makes it a lot of fun having him. I'm glad he's on our team." Another receiver who could be asked to step up in the near future with Austin now dealing with a shoulder injury is Wilson. The second-year receiver out of Michigan is emerging, even if he hasn't had a lot of opportunities yet. "Roman's progressing," said Azzanni. "He's doing a good job. Roman's doing just fine. We just happen to be pretty good at tight end and wideout and what we're doing running the ball. "But Roman, he's in the mix, just like all the other guys. Obviously, his role keeps elevating as the season goes on. It'll just start to happen, and I just tell him when it happens, be ready."

Metcalf, Elliott are co-captains for Steelers Style Skip to main content Advertising Metcalf, Elliott are co-captains for Steelers Style Oct 02, 2025 at 02:32 PM Teresa Varley Steelers.com Copied! Steelers Style, the team's annual fashion show featuring players and their families showing off the latest fashions, will take place on Friday, October 10 at 6 p.m. at Stage AE. The Steelers announced the co-captains for this year's high-energy show, with safety DeShon Elliott and receiver DK Metcalf handling the honor. "It's cool. I have always been recognized for my taste in fashion," said Elliott. "Just to have the chance to co-chair it is special. I am excited for it." -->> Steelers Style Information The theme of this year's show is 'There's No Place Like Home,' which is inspired by the Wizard of Oz and a homage to the people of Pittsburgh. And Steelers fans know there is no place like home, as Acrisure Stadium is always electric on game day. Steelers Style, which is presented by Amazon, Neighborhood Ford Store, PNC, UPMC and UPMC Health Plan, is co-chaired by Art and Greta Rooney and Mike and Kiya Tomlin. Steelers Style, which is the team's largest annual fundraiser, benefits UPMC Sports Medicine Concussion Program, Cancer Bridges and the Chuck Noll Foundation. "To do it for the charities, that is special and really cool," said Elliott. "As players, we are blessed to play this game. But to be able to give back to the community as well, it is really cool." There will also be an online auction, presented by Acrisure, that will benefit the three charities. Items in the auction include signed items and memorabilia from current players, an exclusive private tour of the Steelers Hall of Honor Museum, a chance to design the next Terrible Towel, autographed Limited Edition Terrible Towels, tickets to the Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre's performance of the Nutcracker and a private backstage tour, and more. The auction will run from noon on Oct. 8 though noon on Oct. 17. About the charities: UPMC Sports Medicine Concussion Program: The University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) Sports Medicine Concussion Program, established in 2000, is the first of its kind and largest ongoing clinical service and research program that focuses on diagnosis, evaluation and management of sports-related concussion in athletes of all levels. Led by Michael Collins, PhD, the program's internationally known team of clinicians and researchers are world leaders in studying the neurocognitive effects of sports-related concussion and pioneering the development of better methods of post-concussion evaluation to determine when it is safe for an athlete to return to sports. The team provides oversight and consultation to assist sports teams' medical staff in making objective return-to-play decisions after the occurrence of sports-related concussion. Cancer Bridges: Cancer Bridges supports those impacted by cancer through a variety of free programs and services and has been a proud beneficiary of Steelers Style since 1992. The organization provides a warm and welcoming environment for everyone impacted by cancer, including those with a diagnosis, survivors, and those who have a loved one with cancer or have experienced the loss of a loved one due to cancer. Cancer Bridges serves individuals of all ages and offers nearly 200 programs monthly, providing emotional, social, and informational tools for adults, youth, and families through counseling sessions, support groups, health and wellness programs, social activities, and more. Chuck Noll Foundation: The Steelers launched the Chuck Noll Foundation for Brain Injury Research in 2016 to support continued research and education regarding brain injuries and treatment of sports-related concussions. The Foundation funds research that it believes is the most promising in the area of sports-related concussions and related conditions. To help best evaluate which research programs to fund, some of the most renowned neurosurgeons in the country serve on a national medical advisory panel.
