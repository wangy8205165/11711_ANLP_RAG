The Ticket Tab’s Wallet provides you with quick access and management of all of your MLB tickets. After downloading the MLB Ballpark app, click the Tickets icon on the bottom tab to see all of the tickets you own.

Where can I see more event details about the game? In the team page accessed via the bottom tab bar, you can find detailed information about the day's event.

First confirm that the tickets were purchased with an email address that is verified on the My MLB Account Emails page which is accessible by tapping the Profile icon in the top left hand corner of the Home Tab and then tapping My MLB Account Emails. Next, confirm that a Pirates ticket account is displaying on the My Ticket Accounts page.

Which types of tickets will be displayed in the MLB Ballpark app? The MLB Ballpark app displays regular season, Postseason, Spring Training and other event tickets within the Tickets tab’s Wallet.

See Pirates.com/Groups or Pirates.com/suites for additional group or suite ticket information. When will the tickets I purchase be listed in the Wallet of the MLB Ballpark app?

Each ticket has a mobile ticket barcode that must be scanned for entry into PNC Park via your mobile device. Within the Wallet, you can tap on an individual ticket to view its barcode. For entry to PNC Park, present your mobile device with the mobile barcode open and available to scan. How do I access the ticket to scan for entry? Tap on an individual ticket from the Tickets tab’s Wallet to pull up the mobile ticket barcode. The Section/Row/Seat and barcode will be displayed along with access to the terms and conditions governing your ticket. Why is my ticket barcode not showing in the MLB Ballpark app? There are several reasons why your barcode may not be available including that the ticket has been forwarded, the ticket had been forwarded to you and has since been canceled or recalled, or you are a group or suite buyer and the ticket status has changed. For mailed tickets, the ticket barcode will not appear until those tickets have been printed and mailed to you. For further assistance, contact Pirates Fans Services at ticketservices@pirates.com or 1-800-BUY-BUCS. I just forwarded a ticket via the MLB Ballpark app. Why do I still see it? Your ticket, without the barcode, will remain in your Tickets tab’s Wallet until your forward is accepted by the recipient. If you wish to cancel the forward, you can do that directly from the ticket. During what window of time can I forward tickets to friends? You can forward tickets via the MLB Ballpark app from the moment you purchase them until two hours after the first pitch of that day's game as long as that ticket has not already been scanned in for entry at PNC Park. What should I do if I need to enter PNC Park for the start of the game and the rest of my group is not here yet? You can easily forward tickets to friends via the MLB Ballpark app up to two hours after the start of that day's game as long as the tickets have not already been scanned in for entry at PNC Park. Can I use Apple Wallet for my Pirates tickets? Yes. From the bottom of the ticket inside the MLB Ballpark app you can tap the "Add to Wallet" button to add your ticket to Apple Wallet. Can I use Google Pay for my Pirates tickets? No. Support for adding tickets to Google Pay is not yet available from the MLB Ballpark app. Why won't my ticket barcode scan? If your screen brightness is too low, the barcode may have difficulty being scanned. The MLB Ballpark app will automatically attempt to increase the brightness of your display or you can do so manually by following the instructions for your device. Please note, cracked screens may impact your barcode's ability to scan. The barcode displayed is accompanied by a number. If there are difficulties reading a valid barcode on a digital ticket displayed within the MLB Ballpark app, visit the PNC Park Ticket Office. What if I lose connectivity after I've retrieved my tickets? As long as you have previously viewed your tickets, you will still be able to view your tickets in the MLB Ballpark app even with low connectivity. We recommend viewing and loading your tickets prior to arriving at PNC Park or adding to your Apple Wallet to ensure they are accessible regardless of connectivity. If I access my tickets from the MLB Ballpark app, can I still have them printed at a Will Call window? Since tickets retrieved within the MLB Ballpark app will now be considered printed, the tickets will not be available for pickup at Will Call. You should present the ticket displayed in the MLB Ballpark app on your mobile device for entry at the gate. If you are unable to access your ticket, go to a Ticket Office window for assistance on game day. If you have any questions, please contact Pirates Fans Services at ticketservices@pirates.com or 1-800-BUY-BUCS. What do I do if my mobile device's battery dies?

The MLB Ballpark app allows you to easily forward tickets to family, friends, colleagues, account partners and others with whom you wish to share your tickets so that they can use their ticket on their personal phone. How do I forward a ticket? From the Tickets tab’s Wallet tap on a game to access a list of your tickets. At the bottom of the list tap "Forward Ticket". Select the ticket(s) you wish to forward then choose "Select From Contacts", "Via Email", or “Share Link’. Selecting "Forward Ticket" again prompts you to enter an email address or choose a friend from your Address Book. You can then add the recipient's name (optional) and a message (optional) before tapping "Send" to complete the forward.

No. At this time, "My Pirates Tickets" contacts will not automatically link to the MLB Ballpark app. However, the MLB Ballpark app will automatically link to the address book and contacts in your mobile device. How does Forwarding a Ticket via "Share Link" work? A unique link, which holds the key to your ticket, will be generated and you can distribute it as you see fit. Please only share this link with one person to whom you are forwarding your ticket. If you share the link with multiple recipients, whomever clicks that link and completes the "forward accept" process first will get that ticket. What if I accidentally send the ticket to the wrong email address? You can easily cancel a ticket forward that is in a pending state directly from your list of tickets inside the Wallet. You can then resend the ticket to the correct email address. How will my recipient know I forwarded tickets? Both you and the recipient will receive an email that notifies that the ticket forward has been initiated. The recipient will have a unique link in the email to accept the ticket. If you selected "Share Link," the recipient will receive the notification by whatever method you selected for delivering the link. How do I accept a ticket forward? You must click "Accept" from the email invitation you received. If you do not already have the MLB Ballpark app on your supported iOS or Android device, you will be prompted to download the app. I do not have a supported iOS or Android device. Can I still accept a ticket forward? Yes, you can accept and receive your tickets in a standard web browser. Once a ticket forward has been accepted, contact Pirates Fans Services at ticketservices@pirates.com or 1-800-BUY-BUCS. What if the email address where I received the ticket forward is not the same as the email address associated with my MLB account? The email address at which you received your tickets does not need to match the email address associated with your MLB account, but you will be required to click the link in the email where the ticket was forwarded to. Can I reject a ticket forward? Yes, just click, "I do not want to accept this ticket" on the Ticket Accept webpage. This webpage is accessible only from the ticket forward email sent to the recipient. The sender of the ticket forward will be informed that the invitation was rejected and will continue to have access to the ticket in their MLB Ballpark app If I receive a forwarded ticket, can I re-forward that ticket to another recipient? Yes, a ticket can be forwarded again. Each time a ticket is forwarded, the two participants, the sender and the recipient, will receive a notification of this transaction Can I cancel a Pirates ticket forward? Yes, the sender can cancel a ticket forward any time before the barcode has been scanned. This can be accomplished from the Wallet tab by selecting an individual ticket and tapping "Cancel" or by clicking on the Ticket Forward icon at the top of the Wallet tab. Select the specific Forward then tap "Cancel Forward." The recipient of the ticket you forwarded will be notified. Can I cancel or recall a Pirates ticket forward after it has been accepted? Yes, the original ticket sender can cancel or recall a ticket forward after it has been accepted. The sender and recipient will be notified by email of this action and the ticket will disappear from the recipient's (or anyone they may have forwarded it to) Wallet tab. However, once the ticket has been scanned for entry, the ticket cannot be recalled. Can I cancel a Pirates ticket forward after it has been accepted and re-sent? Yes, the original ticket owner can cancel the forward for a ticket to a Pirates home game regardless of how many times it has been re-forwarded as long as it has not been scanned for entry yet. The sender and original recipient will be notified by email of this action, and the ticket will disappear from the Wallet Tab and/or My Pirates Tickets account of whomever the ticket had last been forwarded to. Can I forward multiple Pirates tickets to a single account? Yes. Tickets can be forwarded together from the same event or one ticket at a time. Where can I find the status of all Pirates Ticket Forwards? You can navigate to the Ticket Forward icon at the top of the Wallet tab. There, you will find all received and sent ticket forwards for your account. What if I never received the Ticket Forward email? If you are expecting to receive a ticket forward but were never notified by email, contact the sender. The sender can cancel the current Ticket Forward then re-send to you by email or share link. If you or the sender are still having difficulties, contact Pirates Fans Services at ticketservices@pirates.com or 1-800-BUY-BUCS. If the person I forward tickets to deletes the email they received to accept the ticket(s) before they click "Accept," what should I do? The ticket owner should cancel their original ticket forward and then re-forward the ticket via the MLB Ballpark app so the recipient receives a new email through which to accept the ticket(s). arrow-up-26204 Back to Top MLB BALLPARK APP - MOBILE TICKET PURCHASE Can I purchase tickets via the MLB Ballpark app?
