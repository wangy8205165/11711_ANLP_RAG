Our History - Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh About Us / Our History The history of Carnegie Museums is bookended by two periods of fantastic growth. It all started in November 1895 with the founding of Carnegie Institute, known today as Carnegie Museums. Andrew Carnegie called the grand building—which included Carnegie Music Hall and Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh—his “monument,” and he considered it the chief satisfaction of his life. A year later, Carnegie Museums held the first Carnegie International , second only to the Venice Biennale as the world’s oldest and most prestigious international exhibition of contemporary art, and the museum’s collection of art quickly grew as a result. The first Carnegie International , 1896. Two years later, in response to news that the bones of “colossal” prehistoric creatures were being found out west, Carnegie sent a scientific crew to Wyoming, where they would discover the first of many world-famous dinosaurs. To make room for the display of his namesake, Diplodocus carnegii , in 1904 Andrew Carnegie broke ground on Carnegie Museums’ first major expansion. While the most famous product of that growth was the great Dinosaur Hall, its neighboring hall, the Hall of Architecture , best embodied Andrew Carnegie’s desire to “bring the world” to the people of Pittsburgh. Becoming the four Carnegie Museums Carnegie Museums’ second most ambitious period of growth began in 1974, with the opening of the Sarah Scaife Galleries, which gave Carnegie Museum of Art’s constantly growing collections their own elegant space. Between 1980 and 1993, Carnegie Museum of Natural History added a number of new exhibit halls : Hillman Hall of Minerals & Gems, Polar World, the Benedum Hall of Geology, the Walton Hall of Ancient Egypt, and the Hall of African Wildlife. In 1986, the expanding cultural powerhouse became known as “The Carnegie,” and, to this day, many in the region still refer to Andrew Carnegie’s Pittsburgh museums as The Carnegie. In 1991, Carnegie Science Center entered the Carnegie Museums fold through a partnership between Carnegie Museums and the Buhl Foundation. The Science Center is home to Buhl Planetarium , the Miniature Railroad & Village , and hundreds of interactive science exhibits. Three years later, in 1994, Carnegie Museums again brought something new and irreplaceable to Pittsburgh, and the world: The Andy Warhol Museum , the most comprehensive single-artist museum in the world, illuminating the art and life of one of the most influential American artists of the 20th century and serving as a global ambassador to Pittsburgh’s cultural richness and diversity.

‘Who can better talk about us than us?’ - Carnegie Magazine Carnegie Magazine / Fall 2025 / ‘Who can better talk about us than us?’ Fall 2025 Main Featured Article Art Community Print A A A Charles “Teenie” Harris, Sgt. William H. Carney, VFW Post 46 band, including Stoney Gloster with trumpet on left, Littleton Coleman “Rich” Richardson and Leroy Brown with saxophones center, 608 Kirkpatrick Street, Hill District, Pittsburgh, (detail) ca. 1942, Carnegie Museum of Art, Pittsburgh, Second Century Acquisition Fund and gift of Milton and Nancy Washington, 1996.55.14 During pivotal decades of social change and racial segregation in the United States, Black photojournalists made it their mission to record the wholeness and humanity of Black life—the mundane, the magical, the meaningful. Think of John W. Mosley’s 1950s photograph for the Black-owned Philadelphia Tribune that features four Black women in bathing suits posing on New Jersey’s “Chicken Bone Beach,” one of many images the Philadelphia-based Mosley made of the segregated section of Atlantic City’s beachfront. His images provided a glimpse of the leisure and the joy Black people found in their communities. John W.

Mosley Photograph Collection, Charles L. Blockson Afro-American Collection, Temple University Libraries, Philadelphia, PA On a sunny day in 1945, the Pittsburgh Courier’ s ace photographer Charles “Teenie” Harris captured several Black women looking cheerful and smart in their military uniforms, as they sold war bonds from a street corner stand in Homestead. Charles “Teenie” Harris, Group in uniform with possibly Ruth Gwynnon on far right, Homestead, Pittsburgh, PA, ca. 1945 Carnegie Museum of Art, Second Century Acquisition Fund and gift of Milton and Nancy Washington, 1996.55.7 Four decades later in Pittsburgh, Bruce Talamon photographed the activist and 1984 presidential candidate Jesse Jackson holding a little boy on his lap while having breakfast in a white family’s kitchen. Jackson had slept over at the family’s home as part of several overnight stays planned with voters during his campaign. And because of photographer A.B. Bell, readers of the Black-owned Dallas Post-Tribune in 1976 could see the pride on the face of Mrs. Claudia Mae Wilborn, a Dallas resident, as she received a “Bicentennial Grandmother” plaque presented to her by her children and grandchildren.

Bell, Mrs. Claudia Mae Wilborn holds Bicentennial Grandmother plaque presented to her by children and grandchildren , May 15, 1976, Documentary Arts, Inc.; Alan Govenar; photo: Courtesy Documentary Arts and The Texas African American Photography Archive They were all part of a broad national network of Black photojournalists who worked outside the national spotlight, facing demanding deadlines and often for low pay. Some risked their lives to tell stories. They hustled, moving between assignments and capturing shots that contradicted negative perceptions of Black communities in crisis—and that were ignored by the white press. More than 250 of those photographs will be exhibited as part of Black Photojournalism , on view at Carnegie Museum of Art from September 13 through January 19, 2026. The exhibition is the first-ever examination by a museum of Black photojournalism between 1945 and 1980, says Dan Leers, the museum’s photography curator, who co-organized this exhibition with Charlene Foggie-Barnett, the Charles “Teenie” Harris community archivist. The exhibition will explore the lives, livelihood, and craft of 60 photographers who navigated living in and documenting Black America. There will be an accompanying book to the exhibition, with the same name. On the cover is a 1954 Teenie Harris photograph of a Pittsburgh Courier press operator, working earnestly to print the next edition of the paper. The book will include nine more Harris photographs that the museum is eager to show to the public for the first time, Leers says. The hefty 400-page volume will feature about 200 photos, including some that won’t be in the exhibition, as well as rich essays and interviews. “We want to emphasize in the exhibition that this history is living. But we know that the photojournalists who documented it are now into their 70s, 80s, and 90s, and a number of them have passed on. That’s why the time is now for this exhibition.” Dan Leers, photography curator, Carnegie Museum of Art Leers says there’s an urgent need to close the gap between what has been recorded about Black life and contributions to American history and what has been represented in mainstream media. “We want to emphasize in the exhibition that this history is living,” Leers says. “But we know that the photojournalists who documented it are now into their 70s, 80s, and 90s, and a number of them have passed on. That’s why the time is now for this exhibition, and to draw attention to the contributions that these Black photojournalists have made to American history.” Birth of the Black Press Carnegie Museum of Art’s archive of more than 70,000 Charles “Teenie” Harris images was just one resource on which Leers and Foggie-Barnett relied. They scoured tens of thousands of images over the past two years and drew from archives and collections in the care of journalists, libraries, universities, museums, newspapers, and photographers. The work took them around the country. And yet, Leers notes, this will be only a partial look at Black photojournalism in America. The exhibition will chronicle historic events and daily life in the United States from the conclusion of World War II in 1945 to the presidential campaigns of 1984, including the civil rights movements through the 1950s, ’60s, and ’70s.

In the mid-1940s, as Black soldiers returned from fighting overseas only to battle racism and segregation at home, Black-owned media was on the rise. This boon provided the best starting place to explore Black photojournalism, says Leers. It was also around the time that the Pittsburgh Courier , one of the nation’s leading Black newspapers, gave Harris his start as a staff photographer. Across the country, Black newspaper subscriptions were climbing. In November 1945, John H. Johnson’s pioneering Black-lifestyle magazine, Ebony , debuted. Just six years later, Johnson launched Jet , billed as “The Weekly Negro News Magazine.” During the almost four-decade span covered in the exhibition, Black photojournalists were capturing it all for the Black press. They were considered lifelines and trusted news sources that transformed how Black people stayed informed, saw themselves, and viewed their communities. Personal Portrayals For Foggie-Barnett, this project was not only historically important but also personal. She was raised in Pittsburgh’s Hill District and Harris was a family friend, as well as the person who documented much of her growing-up years. Without Black photojournalists and the Black press, she notes, her experience and the experiences of so many Black Americans would be threatened by erasure. For more than a century, the Black press has filled the gap. “You would never see images and read the stories of everyday Black people if it weren’t for the Black press,” she says. “You wouldn’t know that Black people were graduating from high school or going on to college and graduating with honors and organizing to uplift their communities.” Without Black photojournalists, for example, many people would not know that Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. did more than march and preach during his short life. The Civil Rights icon will appear in about a half-dozen photographs in the exhibition, but don’t expect to see iconic images from his “I Have a Dream” speech or marching through Selma, Alabama. Moneta Sleet Jr., who covered many critical events in the life of King and his family, made several of the exhibition’s photographs that show King through a more vulnerable lens. In one, there’s King the attentive family man and dad frolicking on his living room floor with Yolanda and Martin Luther King III, his two oldest children. Still in his crisp shirt and tie, a happy and playful King reins in his runaway toddler with a small Hula-Hoop while wife Coretta Scott King looks on from her seat on the sofa.

Courtesy J. Paul Getty Trust and Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture; Made possible by the Ford Foundation, J. Paul Getty Trust, John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, and Smithsonian Institution In another poignant frame, Sleet invites us to gaze at a resting King. He’s on a train in a small, private sleeping car somewhere in Europe. With little light from the window in his room, King’s white shirt and cuff links are still noticeable from atop a blanket that mostly covers him up. King’s eyes are closed, and his hands are clasped on his chest, as in prayer. On that day in 1964, King was en route to receive his Nobel Peace Prize. “You would never see images and read the stories of everyday Black people if it weren’t for the Black press. You wouldn’t know that Black people were graduating from high school or going on to college and graduating with honors and organizing to uplift their communities.” Charlene Foggie-Barnett, the Charles “Teenie” Harris community archivist The exhibition will present many humanizing images of Black luminaries and everyday people, candid moments that can bring the viewer into intimate connection with them. They thrive and live in what Foggie-Barnett calls “a middle space” where there is power and beauty in ordinary moments.

In Ming Smith’s 1976 photograph titled Harlemite at Hotdog Stand, Harlem, NY , we gaze at a man in a dapper white summer suit and shoes as he glances at the camera. In Pittsburgh’s bustling Hill District, Harris takes us out on the town to the Hill City Auditorium (of the Savoy Ballroom) for a set with the Billy Eckstine Orchestra. Singer Sarah Vaughan is to their right, and spectators crowd around. Charles “Teenie” Harris, Billy Eckstine Orchestra with Eckstine on trombone on left, Marion “Boonie” Hazel on trumpet center, Sarah Vaughan on right, and spectators Rita Ings Frazier with flowers in hair and Tommy Turrentine with beret in background, at Hill City Auditorium (Savoy Ballroom), Pittsburgh, PA, October 1944 , Carnegie Museum of Art, Second Century Acquisition Fund and gift of Milton and Nancy Washington, 1996.55.5 In her search for exhibition images, Foggie-Barnett recalls seeing “a lot of content that was just beautiful, impactful photography, even without a storyline.” Many of those images, she says, spoke to that “middle space where everyday life happens, but is least known and understood about Black people, especially by white people.” There will be other opportunities to hear personal stories from living Black photojournalists—about 15—whose work is featured in the show. The museum will host public conversations about the Black press with national archivists, photography curators, and collectors who collaborated with Leers and Foggie-Barnett. And a podcast series will help further the conversation and engage audiences with photographers and archivists. It will be hosted by Mark Whitaker, an award-winning journalist and author of the book Smoketown: The Untold Story of the Other Great Black Renaissanc e. On Location The exhibition also will portray Black life as geographically expansive, showing the diversity of experience among different communities. Even in a glamorous city like Las Vegas, the images reveal a vulnerability in Black icons that could only be captured by Black photojournalists. In one that Clinton Wright shot for the Black-owned Las Vegas Voice in 1965, the famed jazz singer Nancy Wilson steps outside her alluring stage persona. Wilson appears doting as she poses in a nondescript living room with three unidentified Black girls dressed in their Sunday best. In their white-gloved hands, the girls hold checks given to them as part of a fundraiser for a trip to Disney World. From across the United States, Leers and Foggie-Barnett chose images that reflected the depth and richness of Black life in America. They bring into view the elegance of mid-century high-society balls, and the determined look of marchers in the Poor People’s Campaign in 1968. They presented the quiet beauty of Black love in the wintertime on a street in Highland Park, Michigan. Charles Williams, untitled, ca. 1950 , printed 2025, Tom & Ethel Bradley Center, California State University, Northridge, University Library; photo: Courtesy of the Tom & Ethel Bradley Center at California State University, Northridge. “It’s really interesting to talk about these photographers and the work they’re known for geographically,” says Leers. “For instance, if you want to know about photography and see Black life in the Las Vegas Strip, Clinton Wright is your guy. If you want to hear about photography and life in Boston, Don West is your guy.” To understand Black life in the nation’s capital, Leers and Foggie-Barnett turned to Sharon Farmer. She was the first African American woman hired as a White House photographer during the Clinton administration, and the first woman to direct the White House Photography Office. “As Black photojournalists, we created evidence that Black people thrived, we accomplished so much, we persisted as a people despite inequities.” Sharon Farmer, photographer When she was fresh out of college in 1975, Farmer got her start as a staff photographer for The Washington Afro-American newspaper. Founded in 1892, The Afro was one of the Black newspapers and magazines that transformed how people were able to access seeing themselves and their communities. Then, like now, the family-owned paper’s mission is “providing readers with good news about the Black community not otherwise found.” “Their mission was my mission,” Farmer exclaims when reached by phone from her home in Washington, D.C. “I was thrilled to be there.” As a photojournalist, Farmer was aided by her intimate familiarity with the streets and wards in the majority-Black city where she grew up. On assignments, before aiming her camera, Farmer says it was important, and customary, for her to ask Black people who their leaders were and who should fill the frame. “It was a way to give them agency and to build trust,” Farmer notes. From there, her aim was to get the best shot “in three pictures or less.” During her three-years at The Afro , Farmer chronicled everything from the flourishing Go-go music scene that defined D.C. in the 1970s to the complex and celebratory rise of Black political leaders like Marion Barry, the grind of segregation, and everyday life in the city’s wards. “As Black photojournalists, we created evidence that Black people thrived, we accomplished so much, we persisted as a people despite inequities,” says Farmer, who later worked as a staff photographer for The Washington Post . Today, at 74, Farmer is an independent working photographer. The Museum of Art exhibition will feature her 1980 photograph of the Black Prince Hall Freemasons, a fraternal order, in their regalia, celebrating the laying of the cornerstone at Israel Baptist Church in Washington, D.C. ‘Black culture, the richness, the love’ Further north, New York City was a growing hub for Black photographers in the 1960s, and Leers and Foggie-Barnett focused on many who lived, evolved, and made art there. For the installation, they drew from images produced by members of the influential and now legendary Kamoinge Workshop, a collective of independent Black photographers who quietly documented Black life for decades. “Who can better talk about us than us?” proclaimed Anthony Barboza, one of the collective’s living members and original founders, in a 2020 interview with W magazine. But those assigned by mainstream media to capture elements of Black life in the 1960s were rarely Black, says Leers. That left Black photographers like Barboza on the margins, mostly shut out of galleries, shows, and the support of New York’s major museums. So, true to the meaning of Kamoinge— “a group of people acting together”—in Kenya’s Gikuyu language, the group’s members encouraged and mentored each other, shared job leads, and nurtured their skills. And they made it their mission to tell stories about Black communities, life, and culture through their photographs. “I worked to capture Black culture, the richness, the love. That was my incentive. It wasn’t like I was going to make money from it, or fame—not even love, because there were no shows.” Ming Smith, Photographer Ming Smith, America Seen Through Stars and Stripes, New York City, NY, ca. 1973 , Carnegie Museum of Art, Pittsburgh, Margaret M. Vance Fund, 2017.19.5; © Ming Smith. By permission Barboza’s 1972 self-portrait will be featured in Black Photojournalism along with works from other members of the collective, including Ming Smith, Kamoinge’s first female member. Smith’s 1973 photograph titled America Seen Through Stars and Stripes will be among her works on display in the exhibition. The first Black woman photographer to have work acquired by the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, Smith continues to document Black people and culture. In a 2019 Financial Times interview, Smith reflected on the motivation for that work and the often-harsh reality that came with it: “I worked to capture Black culture, the richness, the love. That was my incentive. It wasn’t like I was going to make money from it, or fame—not even love, because there were no shows.” Thanks to the work of Smith and others, Leers hopes visitors leave this first-ever exploration of nearly four decades of Black photojournalism with a new appreciation of the power of photographs—“to influence and inform how we look at, appreciate, and understand a moment in history.

Nurturing Empowerment - Carnegie Magazine Carnegie Magazine / Fall 2025 / Nurturing Empowerment Fall 2025 Featured Articles Community The Inclusive Museum Print A A A Nefertari Galeta became a teacher six years ago for a simple reason: to teach kids. But it’s all of the other “stuff” that came alongside working with middle school math students that made each morning walk to the classroom a struggle. Galeta felt that what was being asked of her as a math teacher wasn’t enough. She tried to balance meeting state standards and getting students ready for the next school year with a more meaningful holistic approach. Unfortunately, there was little time to address the socioemotional skills also lost in the COVID-19 pandemic, which Galeta considered foundational to academic success. “We are expected to be exceptional problem-solvers, educate, and keep forging ahead with minimal support,” she says. She adds that it’s difficult to teach in a way that encompasses the entire scope of her students’ lives when the challenges of their lives take up so much space in the classroom. She also felt alone. In a majority-Black school, she was one of few Black educators on staff. And the challenges that educators face—both inside and outside the classroom—are tough to explain to anyone who hasn’t been a teacher before. Which is why, after spending a long day teaching math to middle schoolers one Thursday in May, Galeta went to Carnegie Museum of Art to be with other people who understand. She was one of around three dozen people participating in the museum’s spring session of the Empowered Educators program, which aims to bring educators together through art to cultivate a deeper understanding of how race and racialized experiences shape the experience of learning for students and teachers. “People are needing a place to come to not just exhale, but inhale as well. Empowered Educators is a place for receiving positivity in the midst of things maybe collapsing around you.” Maisha Johnson, Carnegie Museum of Art’s senior manager of youth and family teaching and learning For one evening each month between January and May, these teachers came together to eat, laugh, study art, write, have conversations, and be authentic with each other. Facilitators guided the groups of educators through artmaking exercises and reflective conversations. Some may have left with ideas for their classroom, but that’s not the point. “People are needing a place to come to not just exhale, but inhale as well,” says Maisha Johnson, the museum’s senior manager of youth and family teaching and learning. “Empowered Educators is a place for receiving positivity in the midst of things maybe collapsing around you.” “[Community] is our anchor, and belonging is critical work that we are intentional about,” says Johnson. “People are looking for a place to be able to just exhale and to receive love and give love.” Needing and Making Space Every evening begins with dinner. Educators must nourish themselves—physically, emotionally, spiritually—before they can nourish others. This Thursday night in May—the fifth and final session of the spring season—the catered dinner included platters of sushi, serving bowls of cold peanut noodles, and hot trays of pork dumplings. As people entered the Ford Mateer Classroom on the museum’s ground floor, they waved and called out to one another, smiled and exchanged hugs before helping themselves to food. “There’s something about that ritual that’s like being part of a family,” says Shari Holland, a licensed professional counselor and director of behavioral science at UPMC McKeesport Family Medicine Residency Program, who teaches residents in the program. “It becomes this natural place to be authentic.” For Galeta, that authenticity is everything. “Empowered Educators is such an important space for teachers,” she says. “It’s a place that is psychologically safe that validates teachers and understands the importance of community.” Surrounded by these colleagues, she doesn’t feel silenced by, or worry about retaliation from, school administrators for speaking the truth about classroom education in 2025. She can just speak. And be heard. The 21/2-hour sessions are free and qualify for ACT 48 continuing education credits. The evenings together include three segments: dinner, viewing art, and making art. Each season has a theme drawn from what’s on display in the museum at that time. Since it began eight years ago, the program has covered a melange of topics, including the utopic possibilities of the internet, Black feminism, and mapmaking. They are all, ultimately, a way of re-seeing the world people think they know. Carnegie Museum of Art launched the program in collaboration with the Western Pennsylvania Writing Project in August 2017 after hearing that some of its student-focused programming, which used art to spark deep conversations among young people, could be helpful to teachers as well. At its start, Empowered Educators asked this question: How does art support relevant, engaging, and equitable learning in classrooms? The initiative, which specifically sought to give teachers tools through art and language to navigate race and identity in learning, was immediately successful. The first evening workshop was fully booked and was repeated three weeks later. Dana Bishop-Root, the museum’s director of education and public programs, says that until relatively recently, what was valuable to the visitor experience was determined by the museum. Empowered Educators embodies how museums are reconsidering that notion, she notes, and are evolving using their resources to meet the needs expressed by their communities. When the COVID-19 pandemic hit and its subsequent fallout took hold, Bishop-Root says teachers’ exhaustion became a growing concern. She recalls them saying, “We also need to be poured into. What our young people are struggling with is deeply painful, and there is so much trauma.” Johnson says Empowered Educators averaged 35-40 participants this spring, nearly double from the year before. The program’s definition of “educator” is broad: classroom teachers, doctors, lawyers, qualitative researchers—anyone who is in a position to hear, influence, or reflect on another person’s story. Karen Howard is a co-founder of Empowered Educators, former classroom educator, and current program facilitator. She says an essential goal was to intentionally create a space where participants and facilitators alike felt safe to be emotionally vulnerable. “Once people know that we’re sincere and we have something of truth to offer, they want it,” she says. “I think everybody wants to be better in what they’re doing.” Creating Difficult Conversations In recent years, the need for fellowship among educators has only become more critical, as school districts become ground zero in the culture wars while teachers figure out how to help close the post-COVID learning gap. More than three-quarters of teachers—78 percent—have considered quitting the profession since COVID, according to a recent University of Missouri survey. “People are seeking, post-pandemic, ways to be in the right relationship with each other,” says facilitator Michelle King. Empowered Educators allows people to engage with difficult questions—especially around race—and difficult answers. That kind of collaboration, King points out, is the very nature of a commonwealth (which Pennsylvania is). The theme for spring 2025 was The Art of Archiving: Remembering, Imagining, and Becoming. It included visits to the Charles “Teenie” Harris Archive, and special exhibitions Raymond Saunders: Flowers from a Black Garden and Gala Porras-Kim: The reflection at the threshold of a categorical division . “As teachers and educators, we are curators, too. There’s a real deep power in what information you put together because there are ways that we are telling the story, both implicitly and explicitly.” Michelle King, Empowered Educator facilitator Over the course of five months, participants spent their time together considering the definition of archiving, its purpose, and what they archive as individuals. For the May session, discussion centered on Porras-Kim’s work on display in the Forum Gallery. The exhibition featured rendered drawings of artifacts from Carnegie Museum of Art, Carnegie Museum of Natural History, and the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh archives. Through these drawings, Porras-Kim asked why museums choose to display—and classify—the objects that they do. One section of the exhibition is the result of asking the museums about the objects they choose not to display. Each related drawing has a description of the object and the reason it’s unlikely to be displayed, such as a vase that once contained human remains. Context is essential to interpreting art and cultural artifacts, King tells the group, and she encourages people to consider the context of their own lives. Toward that end, King asks them, “What’s going on in your lives today? The political climate? School dynamics? What are you dealing with?” Those questions are important to consider, King says, because they influence how educators choose to teach their students. “As teachers and educators, we are curators, too,” says King. “There’s a real deep power in what information you put together because there are ways that we are telling the story, both implicitly and explicitly.” Holland began attending the program at Howard’s encouragement. Not only has it informed her approach to teaching medical students, but it has also challenged her to rethink her own practice as a professional counselor. “Where does my own bias get in the way?” she asks. “I’ve had times where I’ve had to think differently about where I was coming from and ask what the other person is bringing to the experience.” Personal Archives The evening ends with artmaking. Tonight, participants will be finishing a project they’ve been creating over the previous five months—an “archive,” in book form, of their own life experiences. “That’s always my favorite part—everyone is sitting there together, creating,” says Stephanie Flati, who teaches middle school visual art at Winchester Thurston School. The tables on which everyone had dinner only hours before now contain a few basic items like scissors and glue. But it’s around the large table in the middle, piled high with materials and supplies to share, where everyone gets to know each other, says Flati. “Even though it might be a different group of people each time, you would also see someone that you talked to the time before,” she notes. Flati finds that communal-table aspect of the program so wonderful that she’s incorporated it into her own classroom. “There’s something about that ritual [of eating together] that’s like being part of a family. It becomes this natural place to be authentic.” Shari Holland, Licensed professional counselor and Director of Behavioral Science at UPMC McKeesport Family Medicine Residency Program As everyone works, Howard suggests that they be “mindful to remember that we have not gotten into this space and time by ourselves. We were carried here on the shoulders of our ancestors.” That speaks to Holland. She realized in considering personal archives that her grandmother’s quilts acted as such. She remembered her mom pointing out various patches, recalling the dresses they had once been and the people who wore them. With that in mind, Holland included pictures of quilts in her archive book as well as imagery from the Civil Rights Movement. She wrote out her first memory of marching with her dad in 1963; she was 5, and they were protesting a Michigan real estate agency’s policy of not selling homes to African Americans. In making her archive, Galeta considered what it means to fully present the truth and “to continue documenting through periods of turmoil and censorship.” The result was a zine that reflected her values as a “born-a-crime, born-free” South African woman now living in Pittsburgh. Those values: “heart-space, producing more than I’m consuming, responsible community, and spirituality.” These archive projects may never directly inform each person’s classroom, but there’s still plenty of value in their creation. King wants their artmaking to continue outside of this space. “Let this be an invitation for us to be bigger,” she says, “to think about how we can spread love and joy.” Art feeds curious minds and builds community. That goes for everyone—especially teachers. “It is the core of our creation,” Howard says. “We were created; therefore, we create. So go for it, empowered.” Empowered Educators is generously supported by The Grable Foundation.

Mining History - Carnegie Magazine Carnegie Magazine / Fall 2025 / Mining History Fall 2025 Featured Articles Behind the Scenes Print A A A Library Manager Marie Corrado (left) and Curator Lisa Haney view the letters of William J. Holland inside Carnegie Museum of Natural History’s library. Photo: John Schisler When science historian Ilja Nieuwland visited Carnegie Museum of Natural History on a research trip a decade ago, he was dismayed. He’d come from the Netherlands while working on American Dinosaur Abroad , his book about the plaster casts of Diplodocus carnegii that populated European museums in the early 20th century. Leafing through an archive of letters written by William J. Holland, the museum’s second and longest-tenured director, Nieuwland encountered a wellspring of information, not only about the history of the famed dinosaur that came to be known as “Dippy,” but also about the entire field of early American paleontology. More than 100 years on, though, the pages of the Holland letterbooks were in desperate need of conservation. The situation was “dire,” Nieuwland says. The onion-skin paper on which the letters were written had become brittle, degraded by the acid in typewriter ink; he had to wear gloves to avoid further damage. Coal-dusted fingerprints marred the correspondence, letters were fading away, and covers were falling off some of the bound volumes. For a researcher eager to pore through a collection of more than 15,000 pages documenting the origins of the museum and its most storied artifacts, the only clue to guide the process was a handwritten index. The archive—a vast record of Holland’s outgoing correspondence—offered Nieuwland a unique window into the daily activities of a natural history museum at the turn of the century. “Holland was a notorious micromanager,” Nieuwland says. “This causes the correspondences to be inordinately broad and granular at the same time.” Photo: John Schisler Without conservation, he knew all that history might be lost. Nieuwland discussed his concerns with Paul Brinkman, a fellow paleontologist who shared his misgivings. Worried about the archive’s fate, Brinkman wrote to museum staff, urging them to preserve the letters. “Digitization of the Holland correspondence would be an invaluable contribution to the history of American museum science,” he wrote. Over the past two years, the museum’s librarian, an archivist, and its curators have carried out that much-anticipated feat by conserving and digitizing the contents of Holland’s letters so they can be studied for generations to come. With the help of a grant from the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS), the archive is better protected and more easily accessible in digital form. It can now serve as a vibrant resource for exploring the early development of the Museum of Natural History and its contemporaries. “Museums can sometimes seem like their inner workings are inaccessible: You go, you see what’s on the floor, and that’s the museum,” says Lisa Haney, a curator at the museum and the project’s leader. “These letters offer our visitors and other interested people—not just those located here in Pittsburgh—the chance to see what goes on behind the scenes and how this very museum was created.” A First-Person History Carnegie Institute was still in its infancy when Holland, a naturalist and chancellor at the University of Pittsburgh, was tapped to oversee the museum in 1898. With Andrew Carnegie’s largesse, he set out to make the institution “one of the most famous as well as one of the most potent for the good of its class,” as he wrote to a colleague. The archive, which spans 1896 to 1913, tells the story of Holland’s quest, in his own words. Its contents portray him navigating the process of building an American museum’s collection at a time when there was no blueprint for doing so. In letters to partners, researchers, and Carnegie himself, Holland pondered the role of a director in shaping a collection, respectfully requested additional funding to carry out his vision, and described the discovery of Dippy, the acquisition of the Bayet fossil collection, which still accounts for the bulk of the paleontology department, and the arrival of a 4,000-year-old Egyptian funerary boat—all of which still inspire visitors today. “It’s striking seeing the museum find its identity and figuring out how it wanted to work,” says curator Deirdre Smith. Despite the wealth of insight contained in the archive, its use was limited to those who could access it in person—and its condition raised questions about its future. The museum secured the IMLS grant in 2023 with three goals in mind: conserving the letters, creating a searchable digital repository, and expanding access to students, researchers, and museum professionals in Pittsburgh and beyond. As Haney says, the letters hold the answers to a range of important questions about the museum’s history and its place in the development of natural history museums writ large. “In order for us to be able to explore those questions, we first had to complete this project,” she says. Photo: John Schisler Library Manager Marie Corrado (right) and Curator Lisa Haney sift through some of William Holland’s correspondence inside Carnegie Museum of Natural History’s library. Library Manager Marie Corrado sent the archive to Philadelphia’s Conservation Center for Art and Historic Artifacts, where every page was digitized and carefully checked for any necessary mending or cleaning to ensure long-term preservation. The staff at the center built conservation-grade archival boxes to hold the volumes and made high-resolution digital scans of each page so they can be viewed without any further physical handling. Project archivist Hanna Dahlstrom then spent the past year and a half developing a digital database that will allow anyone to search for letters relevant to their interests. “These letters offer our visitors and other interested people—not just those located here in Pittsburgh—the chance to see what goes on behind the scenes and how this very museum was created.” Lisa Haney, Curator Now safely preserved, Holland’s letters are ready to be studied widely. Last fall, Smith, who is also a teaching assistant professor of museum studies at the University of Pittsburgh, incorporated them into her course Inside the Museum, which examines behind-the-scenes museum practices. Students reviewed curated letters from the archive that focused on fossil excavation, Egyptology, and the museum’s Costa Rican collection, then wrote about their own interpretations of the letters. “It was revelatory for them to read,” Smith says. Drawn in by the intimate and engaging nature of personal correspondence, Smith’s students had the opportunity to ponder the context in which Holland and his contemporaries operated and the complexity of their work. As Pitt senior Casey Withers wrote, reviewing a series of letters in which Holland rejected donations to the museum’s collection “provide[d] a glimpse into the personality of both the Carnegie Museum of Natural History and the second director himself.” Grand Ambitions The letters reveal the grand aspirations shared by Holland and his wealthy benefactor and the expansive nature of their collaboration. In some, Holland contemplated why museums exist and what this one should explore. “Chemistry, mineralogy, geology, botany, entomology, ornithology—all the ologies are represented here,” he wrote to a colleague in 1901. In other letters, he offered instruction on fieldwork, including an August 1899 missive in which he celebrated Dippy’s discovery in Wyoming and urged excavators to keep searching for the rest of its bones. “They have not trailed very far away,” he wrote. “There was not very much current in that pond where old Diplodocus lay down and died.” “[Holland] was involved in everything—every little detail of every section and everything that everyone did.” Marie Corrado, Carnegie Museum of Natural History Library Manager The archive offers a window into Holland’s central role in the museum’s development. In his letters, he outlined his ideal staffing structure and contemplated the challenge of securing the most talented experts. But he also tended to the minutiae of organizing a museum, all the way down to the cabinets being built to house its collections. “He was involved in everything—every little detail of every section and everything that everyone did,” says Corrado. In a letter to Carnegie in July 1901, Holland called himself a “committee of one” in addressing the plan and scope for the museum that was to be Carnegie’s “chief monument.” The museum had “a future of great hope and promise,” he said, owing to “the magnificent generosity” of its founder. Holland wasn’t shy about leaning on that generosity, pushing Carnegie to set aside $100,000 (equivalent to about $3.5 million today) to support the publication of scientific research that could compete with other illustrious museums, or reminding his financier that institutions with greater resources were snapping up collections he was pained to lose. In May 1903, he asked Carnegie for $25,000 to secure the Bayet fossil collection, which had been put up for sale in Europe by the Baron de Bayet, secretary to the cabinet of Leopold II of Belgium. Facing competition from museums around Europe and the United States, Holland immediately booked passage on a ship to Europe to complete the deal. The price tag to acquire the massive collection—130,000 fossilized invertebrate and vertebrate specimens that go back hundreds of millions of years—was larger than the entire 1903 budget for all art and natural history acquisitions combined. But Holland assured Carnegie that it was a worthwhile investment, one that would “make our museum one of the Gibraltars of paleontological science in the world.” Connecting to the Past Read as a whole, the letters suggest a man who shrewdly navigated the museum’s development and the acquisition of the collections that came to define it, Smith says. Holland could be “curt and sassy, at times,” she says, including when he found himself unhappy with an employee or donor. But he was always focused on the task at hand. “Holland was a go-getter. If he wanted something to be done he would get it done,” Dahlstrom says. “He didn’t seem like a very soft-spoken guy. He was straight to the point. If he had a complaint, he’d write you 10 pages about why you upset him.” Holland often wrote to the heads of the country’s railway companies asking for free passage of fossils as the museum’s collection expanded, then thanked them by sending along a book he’d written about his favorite subject: butterflies. An accomplished lepidopterist who published influential books on butterflies and moths, he found that leading the museum demanded he become something of a Renaissance man, capable of demonstrating expertise well beyond his subject of choice. Photo: John Schisler “The immense amount of work connected with an infinitude of small details, all of which [require] more or less exact knowledge, is something that at moments appears almost appalling,” Holland wrote. “Every scrap of information which a man possesses is sooner or later brought into play.” For the curators and archivists who have led the effort to preserve the letters, the insight they offer on the museum’s history is a gift to be shared as widely as possible—and they intend to make the digital archive accessible to the public in the near future. A selection of letters will be on display in the museum beginning November 8 as part of the exhibition The Stories We Keep: Bringing the World to Pittsburgh . And Smith plans to dive back into the archive with a new class of students this fall, further extending the letters’ reach. “Being able to get more curious and be more empathic about the museum actors of the past is really important,” she says. Museum staff have always been able to access the archive, but Smith is eager to see more people engage with the letters moving forward, finding “so many unexpected connections and benefits” along the way. That vision is closely aligned with Holland’s own, as he expressed in a letter to Carnegie in 1901. “There are vast territories of knowledge which yet remain in this little world of ours to be explored,” Holland wrote, “and the institution which systematically addresses itself to the work of extending the boundaries of human knowledge covers itself with lustre.” You May Also Like What Lies Beneath A Lifelong Love of Astronomy Closer Look: Walking the Land Four Museums.

Connecting People and Science When It Most Matters - Carnegie Magazine Carnegie Magazine / Fall 2025 / Connecting People and Science When It Most Matters Fall 2025 Featured Articles Community Science & Nature Print A A A Less than two months into Robin Oliverio’s new science communications role at Carnegie Science Center, she had to respond to a crisis. In late February, a Texas child had just died from measles—the first confirmed death from the largest measles outbreak in the state in three decades. Like the virus itself, misinformation was spreading rapidly. Even though Oliverio sat at her desk 1,500 miles away, this was precisely the kind of situation she was hired to communicate about. She immediately crafted a post for the Science Center’s new Science Centered Blog . “I wanted to understand what was happening with the measles outbreak—why it was spreading so fast, how it compared to past outbreaks, and who was most at risk,” says Oliverio, the Science Center’s science communications and media specialist. Oliverio, who holds a Ph.D. in neuroscience, sifted through federal and state health data to answer essential questions such as “What are measles?” “What are the symptoms?” and “How effective is the measles vaccine?” Her “just-the-facts” post titled “Who Gets Measles and Why Is It Back?” cut through the speculation with evidence-based information. Part of a four-part series on measles, the post remains the Science Center’s most-read post this year. The blog series is part of the Science Center’s new Rapid Science Engagement Initiative (RSEI), which aims to respond to science-based news events when it’s most critical for the public to have reliable information. Already known as a community convener for science learning, the Science Center wants to be able to react quickly to news events with science-based activity at their core—like the measles outbreak or the Canadian wildfires, for example—through a three-pronged approach of communications, public programming, and exhibitions. Photo: John Schisler Eve Andrews (left), an exhibit developer, and Robin Oliverio, a science communications and media specialist, converse inside the Science Center’s new podcast room. A RSEI team of a dozen staff members from across Science Center departments meets several times each month to discuss topics for blog content and public programming. Using this RSEI model, the Science Center can develop exhibitions more quickly than usual—in six to nine months, as opposed to a typical timeline of two or more years. Staff will also be able to create more topic-specific programming for the public—including panel discussions with experts—in a matter of weeks as well as share social media and web content in just days. “The three facets—communications, programming, and exhibitions—allow us to reach different audiences in different ways and at different speeds,” says Kim Amey, the Science Center’s chief of staff. “All of these efforts encourage new audiences to turn to us for factual and approachable science content,” said Jason Brown, Henry Buhl, Jr., Director of the Science Center. “Whether through social media, public programming, or exhibits, the RSEI initiative aligns directly with our mission to connect people and science, igniting curiosity that endures for a lifetime.” In this way, the Science Center is acknowledging the critical role that museums play in informing the public. According to the National Awareness, Attitudes, and Usage Study, a majority of Americans—76 percent—consider museums to be trustworthy institutions, more than daily newspapers (60 percent), nongovernmental organizations (60 percent), and the federal government (54 percent). “How do we help our community to make sense of the world?” Amey asks. Going Deeper Amey recounts conversations among Science Center peers when the COVID-19 pandemic began. They wondered how to reach people amid an overload of conflicting information. At the time, the Science Center didn’t have the resources to build comprehensive programming around a single topic, and certainly not within a matter of months. This new rapid response model not only allows the Science Center to be that source of trusted information, but also pushes the museum to be more innovative, says Mary Ann Steiner, research associate at the University of Pittsburgh’s Learning Research and Development Center. “Every day, we’re inundated with so much information at once, and a lot of us don’t have the tools to be able to interpret it.” Robin Oliverio, Science Communications and Media Specialist, Carnegie Science Center “That kind of turnaround is going to break them out of their normal patterns,” says Steiner, who has consulted with the Science Center on how to engage with visitors and choose topics for the pilot. “If you have to do it quickly, then you’ve got to try something different.” While most of the Science Center’s social media posts had traditionally focused on promoting the next event, exhibition, or program, now Oliverio and her colleagues are able to curate science-based content for social media and the website. In addition to the blog, the RSEI team is adding short-form video content and launching a science-based podcast this fall. No matter the platform, the challenge remains the same: to provide scientifically sound information, more quickly, in a digestible form. “Every day, we’re inundated with so much information at once, and a lot of us don’t have the tools to be able to interpret it,” Oliverio says. The RSEI team, which includes Oliverio, plans its editorial calendar around topical seasonal events such as hurricane season, heat waves, and wildfires. But they pivot to address breaking news events, such as a massive storm in April that tore through Pittsburgh, downing hundreds of trees and knocking out power for more than 400,000 residents. That event prompted blog content about understanding winds in a changing climate. A commitment to not oversimplifying the science remains a priority, too. “As a museum, we’re used to making complex topics accessible,” Oliverio says, “but through the blog, I also aim to preserve the depth of the science—whether it’s physics, biology, or statistics. I want readers to walk away with foundational knowledge that empowers them to understand even more complex ideas.” Timely Programming The Science Center’s early foray into rapid response programming came in February 2023 following a train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio. The Science Center assembled environmental experts—two from the University of Pittsburgh School of Public Health, and another from the Pittsburgh Liver Research Center—to answer public concerns about air quality, water safety, and animal well-being. More than 200 people attended the live session, and the recording has since been viewed more than 1,000 times on YouTube. Drone footage shows the freight train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio, on Feb. 6, 2023. Photo courtesy of the National Transportation Safety Board But responses to the webinar highlighted the challenge of cutting through the online discourse. One viewer commented that they had become skeptical of expert opinion: “Look at how many professionals were misguided and wrong about the COVID-19 pandemic. I want to see data.” Another launched into claims of the health threat: “HAVE YOU TESTED FOR DIOXINS. NO, YOU HAVEN’T. SO, stop talking things are safe when you don’t know about dioxins!” Still, this feedback, even when it’s negative, can serve the Science Center well, Steiner says. Sometimes what is perceived as a negative response is a signal that the person is really thinking about the content and wrestling with ideas. This can help the team to better understand how to engage the audience with such complex topics. “Let’s open up the amount of time we spend listening to how people respond to things and give people opportunities to define what their questions are,” she says. Recently, Science Center staff developed a transportable “extreme weather” activity to contextualize events like July’s flooding in Texas. Visitors to the museum sprayed water on a model landscape, about the size of a cookie sheet, to see how stormwater flows during a normal storm. Then they poured a “flood” of water from a cup to demonstrate how flash flooding occurs during extreme rain. Museum educators encouraged guests to record the impacts of extreme weather in their own lives. One senior visitor who used a mobility device wrote that she couldn’t leave her home. Other visitors cited transportation disruptions from road closures, and one hospital worker shared that an extreme heat event led to power reductions that limited the hospital’s ability to perform surgeries. “All of these efforts encourage new audiences to turn to us for factual and approachable science content.” Jason Brown, Henry Buhl, Jr., Director of the Science Center “We’re actively seeking out what it means to be relevant,” Amey says. The Science Center is also engaging people outside the museum, at community events including festivals and farmers markets, as well as at its own adult programming, to learn what kinds of topics are of interest, and how people understand them. During a recent 21+ after-hours event at the Science Center, the RSEI team organized an activity to assess how climate change was relevant to people’s experiences. They asked participants to choose from cards with different topics—recreation, conservation, energy, jobs, etc.—to find one that most concerned them. “Taking that time to talk with people helps us. Climate change can feel like a politicized topic,” Steiner says. “And hearing how many people are thinking about it and wondering about it and curious about it helps an institution like a museum feel a little bit more confident presenting it in a way that’s about solutions and possibilities, and not just thinking of it as an inevitable dire future.” Expediting Exhibitions The first Rapid Science exhibition will debut in early 2026. It’s designed to be modular and adaptable—built to swap in new content, graphics, and activities when the subject matter is ready to change. The framework will be reused, significantly reducing the amount of time it takes to introduce new topics on the gallery floor, and designed in a way that it will fit anywhere in the museum. Climate change was selected as the first topic for the exhibit’s test run based on visitor feedback, collected through online surveys and written notes. “Visitors told us overwhelmingly that they wanted to learn more about climate change,” says Eve Andrews, exhibit developer at the Science Center. “And it’s a smart topic choice because these exhibits take months to develop and stay open for roughly a year, so they have to address subject matter that will remain relevant beyond a few trending headlines.” Photo: John Schisler Members of the Science Center’s design and fabrication team gather inside the “design suite” to discuss exhibit changes. Pictured are (left to right) Jennifer Lawrence, Bryan Abraham, Eve Andrews, Azur Cherin, Doug DeHaven, and Nino Balistrieri. Amey says the larger vision is to create an “inviting and emotionally resonant experience that also inspires action.” They’ll do this through interactive displays, powerful visuals, and storytelling elements that connect climate science to everyday life. And it’s not a one-way conversation, says Jennifer Lawrence, director of experience design and fabrication. There will be opportunities for discussion, including tables with activities, as well as couches and seats where people can comfortably reflect on the information they’ve just encountered. “What we really hope will happen is that people use this exhibit space as a safe place to engage in these kinds of difficult conversations,” Lawrence explains. The RSEI team is also aware of the risks of tackling controversial issues. So they’ve created an internal rubric to evaluate the risk/reward of taking on a heated topic. Ultimately, no matter what topic they’re addressing, they hope to be a conduit for learning through respectful dialogue. “There are so many spaces that are overrun with misinformation,” Andrews says. “The Science Center is one that has been saved from that. We want to build that trust in the community by creating spaces for people to learn more about what they might be hearing, but in a more clarifying, educational way.” You May Also Like Printmaking with Purpose A Path Forward ‘Who can better talk about us than us?’ Four Museums.

Email: membership@carnegiemuseums.org Mail: Carnegie Museums 4400 Forbes Avenue Pittsburgh, PA 15213 Attention: Membership Carnegie Museums Online Privacy Policy Last Updated January 3, 2022 Carnegie Museums (“Carnegie Museums” or “us” or “we” or “our”) own and operate a number of web sites and mobile applications including but not limited to the carnegiemuseums.org, cmoa.org, carnegiesciencecenter.org, carnegiemnh.org, and warhol.org web sites (the “Sites”). This privacy policy (“Policy”) applies to information collected by Carnegie Museums through the Sites, through any other online location where this Policy is published, and through our other interactions with you, including but not limited to, via mail, telephone, email, online transactions, online programming and onsite visits at our museums or to Carnegie Museums programs, exhibits or events at other locations (collectively with the Sites, the “Services”). This Policy only applies to information that you provide or we collect from you through the Services identified above. Other web sites, mobile applications, and online services, including any third-party services you use to interact with Carnegie Museums, may have their own privacy policies and you should consult those policies accordingly. Policy Changes Carnegie Museums reserves the right to change this Policy at any time. Since this Policy may change as we modify or expand our Services, we suggest you check back from time to time in order to understand how we currently handle your information. Our Policy’s effective date will always be set forth at the beginning and end of the Policy. Any changes will be immediately incorporated into this Policy. Any change to this Policy is effective immediately. Your continued use of the Services after any changes are made to this Policy constitutes your acceptance of the changes. If any changes are unacceptable to you, you are no longer authorized to use the Services and should cease all such use. The Information We Collect Personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) is generally defined as information that, by itself or in combination with other information, is reasonably capable of being linked to a specific individual. Depending on how you interact with Carnegie Museums, there are certain aspects of the Services where we will only collect Personal Information which you knowingly and voluntarily provide, and other aspects of the Services provided through the Sites where we may automatically collect data from you, including your Internet Protocol address (IP address), cookies, and other online identifiers that may include portions of Personal Information through the use of tracking technology (see the “Information Collected Automatically” section, below). For example, Personal Information you voluntarily provide to the Carnegie Museums may include, but is not limited to, your name, address, telephone number, email address, username and password, age/birthdate, credit/debit card number or other payment information, photograph, image, voice, likeness or other identifiable characteristics, office address and other business or organizational information, or any other type of data that, directly or indirectly, is reasonably capable of being associated with someone. You may be asked to provide such Personal Information to Carnegie Museums when you: complete and submit forms to become a member of Carnegie Museums; send emails or other communications to Carnegie Museums; register for events, camps, classes or other programs; purchase tickets for admission, events or programs; provide permission forms for events, camps, classes or other programs; rent space at the museums; sign up to receive emails or other communications from Carnegie Museums; contact Carnegie Museums with questions, comments, or other messages; participate in online programming or other online events; donate or provide gifts to Carnegie Museums; respond to surveys; or otherwise provide any information to us voluntarily through the Services. Carnegie Museums generally will not ask you to provide any sensitive data, such as your religious beliefs, citizenship status, sexual orientation, or your race or ethnicity, but you may be able to voluntarily provide such sensitive data in content that you upload, post or otherwise provide on or through the Services. To the extent you voluntarily make any sensitive data available through the Services, you hereby acknowledge and agree that such data may be processed by Carnegie Museums as necessary to provide the Services in accordance with your instructions. Information Collected Automatically There are areas of the Sites where Carnegie Museums or our service providers may automatically collect certain data as you use the Sites and navigate elsewhere online, such as your IP address and other data about your Internet connection, your operating system, browser type, and other services or equipment you use to access the Sites, and usage data about your interaction with our Sites. This automatically collected data generally does not identify any specific individual, but to the extent such data is reasonably capable of identifying you or another person, we will treat such data as Personal Information. This automatically collected information may include data on how you use our Sites, what pages you have visited, or any errors that occurred while you were visiting our Sites. This information may be used by Carnegie Museums to help us in developing content and improving our Sites to create the best experience for our visitors. The technology used to automatically collect this information may utilize cookies, which are small files sent to your browser by our Sites when you visit. Cookies can be used to track usage patterns, trends and visitor behavior, as well as to record other information regarding your visit. These cookies may allow us to share information with our trusted advertising partners which enables us to present you with retargeted advertising on third-party web sites and/or social media platforms based on your previous interactions with our Sites. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies but you can change the preference on your browser to reject them. Doing so however, may affect your ability to use certain features of our Sites. We may also use third-party analytics providers which could automatically collect certain Personal Information and other data about you through the Sites including, but not limited to, your IP address and/or other online identifiers. Third-party cookies or other tracking technology may be used through this process to track data such as the times you most frequently use the Sites, what devices you use to access the Services, what parts of the Services you visit and the links you use to get there. These data and analytics service providers may use such information to track how you use the Services, measure the performance of the Services, improve features on the Services, and provide Carnegie Museums with tools that satisfy overall operating needs for the Services. Carnegie Museums may then use feedback from these service providers to improve the Services and our interactions with you. All of the above-referenced IP addresses and other data will be collected in an automated manner and we may maintain that information or associate it with certain other data, which may include Personal Information you provide voluntarily through the Services. This helps us improve our Services, deliver better and more personalized Services, estimate our audience size and usage patterns, and store information about your preferences. How We Use Your Information Carnegie Museums may use your Personal Information and other data to appropriately respond to your requests and to provide a variety of Services. Personal Information regarding your interests will allow us to provide materials to meet your specific needs. Museum personnel may, for example, use the Personal Information to customize offers, target communications through mail and email, and to present you with retargeted advertising on third-party web sites and/or social media platforms. More specifically, Carnegie Museums may use your Personal Information and other data to: deliver exhibits, programs and content on or through the Services; administer registrations for events and provide virtual learning programs and other Services; request and process donations and other gifts you provide to Carnegie Museums; maintain proper records consistent with applicable law; respond to your questions, comments or other messages; keep you up to date on events and programs happening at Carnegie Museums’ locations; send you communications about our Services; invite you to events; provide ongoing technical support related to the Services; improve the content on the Sites and the general administration of the Services; perform internal operations related to the Sites (e.g., spam and fraud prevention); troubleshoot software issues and operational problems with the Sites; conduct data analysis and testing; monitor usage of the Services; and/or otherwise advance Carnegie Museums’ Services, offerings, or mission. Carnegie Museums or its designees may, from time to time, compile statistics on visitors to our museums and Sites and/or work with others compiling statistics or performing other quantitative analysis. In these situations, data that Carnegie Museums has related to your interactions with the Services may be used to aggregate statistical information to analyze visitor interest or other aspects of non-profit organization-related activities. The information aggregated will not include any Personal Information as it relates to a single visitor. Sharing Information Carnegie Museums may share certain portions of Personal Information with vendors that help provide certain Services on behalf of Carnegie Museums in order to make the Services function properly. This may include sharing certain kinds of Personal Information, including without limitation, your credit card, debit card or other payment information, and/or your voice, likeness and any other Personal Information you make available in connection with Carnegie Museums’ virtual learning programs or other Services with: Payment processors to administer donations and other payments you submit through the Services; Video conference service providers that assist us in providing our virtual learning programs and other Services; and/or Third-party personnel such as experts, judges, presenters and other individuals who help provide certain Services in connection with Carnegie Museums’ events and programs. Under certain circumstances, we may trade or exchange contact information such as your mailing and email addresses among other Personal Information you provide during registration processes online, over the phone, or in-person at our museum locations, with reputable third-party museums and other cultural organizations that are not related to Carnegie Museums. If you do not want your information to be provided to such third-party organizations in connection with this activity, please contact us at membership@carnegiemuseums.org or call us at 412.622.3314. You also can review the “Your Choices” section, below, for other details on how you may be able to request changes regarding Carnegie Museums’ handling of Personal Information it maintains about you. As stated above, Carnegie Museums may use video conference service providers when providing virtual learning programs or other online events. When registering for such online Services, please review any information made available about the video conference service provider for the applicable program or event, including that provider’s privacy policy, for more details about how that provider may handle the Personal Information or other data it collects from you. Other third parties, such as social media platforms and other providers of services that rely on user generated content may be able to collect certain data that could include your Personal Information over time and across different online services when you interact with the Sites and other online Services. If at any time it becomes reasonably necessary, we will release the Personal Information and other data Carnegie Museums maintains about you if we reasonably believe we are required to do so by law or in cooperation with a government or law enforcement investigation, to comply with a court order, or to protect the rights, property or safety of Carnegie Museums, its personnel, the users of its Services, or others. Personal Information received or held by Carnegie Museums may be transferred if our ownership status changes. Under such circumstances, Carnegie Museums will make reasonable efforts to cause any successor to agree to abide by the terms of this Policy. We also may disclose your Personal Information to other service providers to carry out our obligations and enforce our rights arising from any contracts related to your use of the Services, or as otherwise described to you at or before the point when we collect your Personal Information. As a donor, member, and visitor of the Carnegie Museums, as a user of the Sites or our other Services, and by providing to or otherwise allowing Carnegie Museums to collect the Personal Information and other data referenced above, you agree, without limitation or qualification, that Carnegie Museums may process such Personal Information and other data in accordance with the terms of this Policy, as it may be amended from time to time. Again, please check back periodically for changes to this Policy. Your Choices Depending on where you are and how you use our Services such as, for example, if you participate in our membership program, you may be able to ask questions or make certain choices with respect to Personal Information you provided to Carnegie Museums, or that Carnegie Museums may have collected about you. For example, in some situations you may be able to request (subject to applicable legal exceptions): Confirmation of whether Carnegie Museums has collected and is processing your Personal Information; Correction of any inaccuracies about your Personal Information, depending on what kind of Personal Information it is and the purposes for which Carnegie Museums is processing that data; Deletion of Personal Information you provided to Carnegie Museums or that we have otherwise collected about you; and That Carnegie Museums stop processing your Personal Information for certain purposes other than what is necessary to provide the Services or as required by applicable law. In addition, depending on where you are when you use our Services, you may submit requests regarding Personal Information you provided to Carnegie Museums, or that Carnegie Museums may have collected about you, such as requests to: Restrict our processing of your Personal Information in certain circumstances, such as in the event you contest the accuracy of the information; Access the Personal Information we hold about you; and Object to or withdraw any consent, in certain circumstances, for marketing activities that involve the use of your Personal Information (this may result in deletion of the Personal Information). If at any time you would like to request the ability to edit or delete any Personal Information Carnegie Museums may have about you, opt-out of receiving further information from Carnegie Museums, limit what we share, or if you otherwise wish to ask Carnegie Museums to cease using your Personal Information in the manners specified in this Policy (subject to any applicable legal exceptions), please call the Membership Office at 412.622.3314 or send us an email using the address membership@carnegiemuseums.org. Carnegie Museums is required to try to verify the identity of any person or entity that requests the disclosure or deletion of Personal Information. If you have a password-protected account with us, we will use our existing authentication procedures to verify your identity. For most other requests, Carnegie Museums will ask you to provide information that matches at least two pieces of Personal Information we store about you before responding to your request. If more information is needed to verify your identity in certain situations, Carnegie Museums may deny your request or ask for more details as necessary to protect your Personal Information from unauthorized access, disclosure and deletion. We cannot respond to your request or provide you with Personal Information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the Personal Information relates to you. Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us, nor does it guarantee that we will be able to process your request. We will only use Personal Information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request. The Carnegie Museums reserve the right to refuse any request made regarding your Personal Information if we are unable to process the request for any reason, such as if we are unable to verify the identity of the person making the request or if we cannot authenticate the legitimacy of the request using reasonable efforts. Carnegie Museums is under no obligation or duty to verify the legitimacy of any request regarding Personal Information. Any removal of content by Carnegie Museums does not ensure or guarantee complete or comprehensive removal of the content in all places. The content may have been shared or reposted by other parties, or federal or state law may require maintenance of the content or information. Carnegie Museums will do our best to accommodate your request, but we cannot guarantee we can remove all Personal Information from the specified uses. Therefore, please be as specific as possible in your request. If the request relates to information Carnegie Museums needs to make the Services function properly for you, you may not be able to use the Services properly moving forward. Carnegie Museums reserve the right to maintain proper records as required by law, or for otherwise legitimate purposes to the extent permitted by law, even if such records contain your Personal Information. If you would like to opt-out of receiving promotional emails from the Carnegie Museums, please follow the opt-out instructions at the bottom of the email or send us a detailed email at membership@carnegiemuseums.org . Some browsers have a “do not track” feature that lets you tell web sites you do not want to have your online activities tracked. The Sites are not currently configured to respond to “do not track” or similar automated privacy controls. To learn more about ways to possibly opt-out of certain kinds of tracking that occur when you browse the Internet generally and may lead to targeted advertising, visit the Network Advertising Initiative web site and the Digital Advertising Alliance web site . Options you select are browser- and device-specific, and there is no guarantee that these industry-provided opt-out tools will prevent all targeted advertising. As noted previously in this Policy, it is possible that certain third parties may receive information through the Services. Since some of these third parties may respond differently than Carnegie Museums to “do not track” requests, you should consult the applicable privacy policies of those third parties for that information. Information Security To protect your Personal Information, Carnegie Museums uses appropriate technical and organizational security measures to protect against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure or destruction of your Personal Information and other data stored on or through our Services. Personal Information provided to or collected by Carnegie Museums is transmitted using SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption. SSL is a proven coding system that lets your browser automatically encrypt, or scramble, data before you send it to us. We also protect account information and other data that could include your Personal Information by placing it on a secure portion of our Sites that are only accessible by certain qualified employees of Carnegie Museums. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure. While we strive to protect your information as much as possible, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of that information. The transmitted information may be intercepted by others before it reaches Carnegie Museums, for example. Therefore, you should exercise discretion in what information you disclose and/or transmit through the Sites. If you are concerned about sending information to Carnegie Museums online, please send the information by mail or call us to make other arrangements. Carnegie Museums is not responsible for the security of information transmitted online. Carnegie Museums retains collected information for as long as needed to fulfill the stated purpose for which the Personal Information was collected or otherwise processed, and thereafter for a variety of legitimate purposes in support of Carnegie Museums and our Services. Carnegie Museums also will retain collected information connected to organizational records for periods of time required or permitted by law. These may include retention periods that are: (1) mandated by law, contract or similar obligations that apply to Carnegie Museums’ operations; (2) for preserving, resolving, defending or enforcing our legal/contractual rights; or (3) needed to maintain adequate and accurate organizational records. If Carnegie Museums determines that information is no longer needed and no legal obligation to retain such data exists, it will delete such information. Our record-keeping times will be consistent with applicable law. If you have any questions about the security or retention of your Personal Information, please contact us. Children’s Information Carnegie Museums may collect certain Personal Information from teenagers who are between 13-18 years old and qualify to receive free access to the Carnegie Museums and our Services through our Teen Membership program. We will use this Personal Information to introduce teens who enroll in the program to our museum locations and Services, to organize events and tours related to the Teen Membership program, to provide transportation to such events and tours, and to partner with community-based organizations that serve teens. The Sites are not directed at, marketed to, nor intended for, individuals under 13 years of age. No one under the age of 13 is authorized to use the Sites, and minors younger than 13 are not permitted to provide any information on or through the Sites without the verified consent of any such minor’s parent(s) or legal guardian(s). If you are under 13 years of age, DO NOT: use or provide any information on or through the Sites; use any of the Sites’ features; use any interactive or public commenting feature on the Sites or through other online Services; and/or provide any information about yourself to Carnegie Museums. Carnegie Museums does not and will not knowingly collect or request any information, including Personal Information, from any person under 18 years of age without the consent of the minor’s parent(s) or legal guardian(s). If Carnegie Museums learns that we have received Personal Information from any person under 18 years of age without the appropriate consent of the minor’s parent(s) or guardian(s), Carnegie Museums will delete that information. If you are a parent or legal guardian of a child under the age of 18, and would like to enroll your child in Carnegie Museums’ virtual learning programs or other online Services, believe your child may have used or uploaded or posted information through the Sites inadvertently or without authorization, and such information is publicly available, or if you believe Carnegie Museums might otherwise have information from or about any person under 13 years of age, please contact us immediately at membership@carnegiemuseums.org . International Use and Transfers If you are outside of the United States, you are responsible for complying with any local laws regarding your use of the Services, and any related data collection. You also agree and acknowledge that by providing any data through the Services, including Personal Information, that such information may be transmitted to, and stored in, the United States. If you are in the European Economic Area (the “EEA,” which includes the 27 European Union Member States, Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein), Switzerland or the United Kingdom (collectively, the “EU”) when you use our Services, or if you use our Services from other regions with laws governing the collection, use and transfer of Personal Information across international borders, please note that you are agreeing to the transfer of your information to the United States and processing globally. By providing your information, you hereby agree to permit any transfer and processing by Carnegie Museums in accordance with this Policy. If you are located in the EU, then with the exception of uses for which we have obtained your consent, your Personal Information is processed to perform our obligations under a contract with you or another organization on behalf of which we are providing Services, or where the processing is in support of our legitimate interests as described in this Policy and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms under any data protection laws and regulations that may be applicable. Under the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), individuals in the EU also may have the right to lodge a complaint about Carnegie Museums’ processing of your Personal Information with a supervisory authority. In particular, such individuals may lodge a complaint in the EU Member State where they live or work or where the alleged violation took place. Your Personal Information may be disclosed to and processed by staff operating in the United States. Disclosure will be to individuals who work for Carnegie Museums and organizations with which we have contracted to process or store this data on Carnegie Museums’ behalf. The entities that receive Personal Information as a result of international transfers are required to follow our instructions with respect to the use of Personal Information and comply with appropriate security measures to protect your information. External Links The Services may contain links to external web sites or other online services, including those embedded in third-party advertisements or sponsor information, which are not controlled by Carnegie Museums. We are not responsible for the privacy practices and data collection policies for such third-party services. You should consult the privacy policies of those third-party services for details. Carnegie Museums may also allow interaction between our Services and other third-party services online, including social media providers. This interaction may include plugins that allow you to share information with persons outside of the Services.

Prohibited conduct includes all forms of sex and gender-based discrimination, harassment, violence, assault, dating violence, domestic violence, interpersonal violence, stalking, and sexual exploitation. This policy prohibits sex discrimination or harassment against all CMP employees and all students who participate in CMP’s educational programs or activities by any persons involved in CMP’s operations and educational activities, regardless of their position, including: employees, volunteers, students, trustees, advisory board members, committee members, contractors, vendors, or other CMP-affiliated individuals. Title VI, Section 504, and Age Discrimination Act Compliance CMP also prohibits discrimination or harassment against students who participate in CMP’s educational activities or programs by any persons involved in CMP’s operations and educational activities, regardless of their position, on the basis of age (40 and over), race, color, national origin, or disability, as required by law. CMP also prohibits retaliation against someone for reporting prohibited conduct. This policy requires CMP to: 1) investigate reports of prohibited conduct under this policy, 2) establish formal and informal grievance procedures to ensure a fair process, and 3) appoint Coordinators. Inquiries or complaints related to this policy should be directed to CMP’s Department of Human Resources at HRConnect@carnegiemuseums.org or 412-622-3311. Anyone who violates this policy will be subject to appropriate disciplinary action, up to and including suspension, expulsion, and/or termination of employment. Role and Responsibilities of the CMP Coordinators CMP has designated a Title VI, Title IX, Section 504, and ADA Coordinator (“Coordinator”). Additionally, CMP has designated a Deputy Coordinator for each museum component and central services department and for its students. The Coordinator is responsible for: 1) ensuring CMP complies with and carries out its responsibilities under Title VI, Title IX, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, and the Age Discrimination Act, and its implementing regulations; 2) educating the museum community about how to file a complaint and the investigation process; and 3) overseeing the implementation of this policy, grievance procedures, and the investigation process. All questions or complaints may be referred to the Coordinators at the Department of Human Resources. General contact information for the office is below. Information about specific personnel for each component within the office can be found in CMP’s grievance procedure within this policy, entitled “Reporting Procedure for Sex Discrimination & Harassment.” Coordinators can be reached at the Department of Human Resources, Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh, 4400 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15213, 412-622-3311, HRConnect@carnegiemuseums.org. The CMP Coordinator is: Knowledgeable about and trained in CMP’s policies and procedures against harassment and discrimination; Involved in drafting and revising CMP’s policies and procedures to ensure compliance with federal and state law; Available to advise any individual, including a complainant, a respondent, or a third party, about the courses of action available at the museum, both informally and formally; Available to advise any CMP community member about how to appropriately respond to reported misconduct; Responsible for monitoring outcomes, identifying and addressing patterns, assessing effects on museum climate, and overseeing compliance with all procedural requirements outlined in the policy; and Authorized to determine outcomes of complaints so long as no conflict of interest exist. Scope of Policy This policy supplements CMP’s other anti-discrimination and harassment policies for persons covered by the terms of this policy. Prohibited Conduct Defined – Harassment and Discrimination Sex Harassment and Discrimination All CMP employees, volunteers, students, trustees, advisory board members, committee members, contractors, vendors, or other CMP-affiliated individuals are prohibited from discriminating against or harassing CMP employees and students who participate in CMP’s educational programs or activities under this policy based on that individual’s sex or gender (including pregnancy), sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, and regardless of the harasser’s sex or gender. Sexual harassment means any harassment based on someone’s sex or gender. It includes harassment that is not sexual in nature (for example, offensive remarks about an individual’s sex or gender), as well as unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors or visuals, or any other conduct that is of a sexual nature. Sexual harassment includes various forms of offensive behavior based on sex. Examples of prohibited conduct can be found in CMP’s policy on “Sexual & Other Unlawful Harassment.” Other Harassment or Discrimination Under this policy, CMP also prohibits discrimination or harassment by employees, volunteers, students, trustees, advisory board members, committee members, contractors, vendors, or other CMP-affiliated individuals against students who participate in CMP’s educational activities or programs on the basis of that student’s age (40 and over), race, color, national origin, or disability, as required by law. Complaint Procedure Any CMP employee or student who believes they have been subjected to prohibited discrimination, harassment or retaliation under this policy, or who are aware of perceived discrimination, harassment or retaliation against other CMP employees or students covered by this policy that violates this policy, should immediately report any such conduct to the Coordinator under the “Reporting Procedure for Discrimination and Harassment” outlined in this policy. Reporting Procedure for Discrimination & Harassment CMP encourages any CMP employee or student covered by this policy who believes they have been subjected to prohibited discrimination, harassment, or retaliation under this policy, or who are aware of any such conduct against others, to immediately provide a written or verbal report to the Department of Human Resources Coordinators. Each CMP component has a primary Coordinator along with deputy coordinators, whose information is contained in this policy. Complaints may also be made to the Department of Human Resources by email at HRConnect@CarnegieMuseums.org.

Confidentiality will be maintained to the extent practical and permitted by law. Investigations will be conducted as confidentially as possible and related information will only be shared with others on a need-to-know basis. Those involved in such investigations are required to be truthful, accurate, and cooperative throughout the investigation process. Those who report misconduct are known as complainants. Those against whom a complaint is lodged are known as respondents. Complaints should be as detailed as possible and include a description of the complained of conduct, the names of all individuals involved as well as any witnesses, and the dates on which the complained of conduct occurred. If discrimination, harassment, or retaliation is substantiated, appropriate disciplinary action, up to and including suspension, expulsion, and/or termination of employment, will be taken. CMP may also report conduct to law enforcement, as appropriate. Initial Assessment The Coordinator will conduct an initial assessment of any reported conduct. As part of the assessment, the Coordinator will, among other things: consider the expressed resolution preferences by the reporting party; assess the circumstances surrounding the alleged misconduct; address any immediate physical and emotional safety concerns; notify the reporting party of their right to contact law enforcement if warranted by the circumstances; provide the reporting party with information about the procedural options available under this policy; assess for pattern evidence by the respondent; and explain CMP’s policy prohibiting retaliation. Following the initial assessment, the Coordinator will determine whether this policy is implicated and whether an informal or formal resolution is appropriate and articulate those conclusions to the complainant. CMP strives to assess, investigate, and resolve all reports of potential misconduct under this policy within sixty (60) days. Resolution and Investigation Procedures Informal Resolution CMP’s informal resolution process aims to appropriately investigate and, if necessary, address alleged misconduct without requiring a formal resolution process described below. Under an informal resolution process, a complainant reports alleged misconduct under this policy to the Coordinator. The Coordinator will give notice to the respondent of the alleged misconduct and may gather necessary facts by interviewing the complainant and respondent. At their discretion, the Coordinator may gather additional information by meeting with relevant witnesses (identified by either the Coordinator or the complainant and respondent) and collecting any evidence, including correspondence between the parties. Each party may be heard throughout the informal resolution process. CMP strives to complete any informal resolution process within thirty (30) days; however, the timeline may be longer due to the complexity of the allegations. Following an investigation, the Coordinator may or may not then impose sanctions or other disciplinary action as appropriate. Neither party may appeal an informal resolution once final. Formal Resolution If the Coordinator deems a formal resolution to be appropriate, CMP will begin the formal resolution process described in this sub-section. CMP strives to complete any formal resolution process within sixty (60) days excluding any appeals; however, the timeline may be longer due to the complexity of the allegations. During an investigation, both complainants and respondents may have an appropriate advisor who may observe any hearings or interviews as well as provide support, guidance, and advice during an investigation. The Coordinator will begin or continue an investigation by providing written notice to each party that an investigation has begun and will also appoint an investigator. The appointed investigator may be a CMP Coordinator that will not formally adjudicate the complaint or external appointed investigator appointed at CMP’s sole discretion. The appointed investigator will gather necessary facts by interviewing the complainant and respondent. At their discretion, the investigator may conduct other fact-finding by meeting with relevant witnesses and gathering any evidence, including correspondence between the parties. Each party is entitled to be heard throughout the investigation process. Following the investigation, the investigator will submit a written report summarizing the facts and outlining areas of agreement and disagreement between the parties. The report may redact irrelevant or prejudicial information as necessary. The Coordinator will then share the report with each party, allowing them time to review. A party has five (5) days to review the report and submit responses for consideration into the final report. Once a report is finalized, the investigator will determine whether the respondent is responsible for the alleged misconduct. The investigator will use a “preponderance of the evidence” standard and inquire whether the evidence is sufficient to support a finding of misconduct. Upon this determination, the investigator will recommend adjudicatory action and sanctions to the Coordinator, including, but not limited to: a warning letter, suspension, expulsion, termination, or a no contact order. The Coordinator will then formally adjudicate through a written letter to each party notifying them of the outcome. Either party has the right to appeal the adjudicatory action letter submitted by the Coordinator. A party must appeal the letter in writing within ten (10) days and must state one of three limited grounds: 1) a procedural error which materially affected the outcome of the investigation; 2) the existence of new information unavailable to the investigators during the investigation which could have materially affected the outcome; or 3) the recommendation of the investigators and/or adjudicatory action taken by the Coordinator was clearly erroneous based on the evidence gathered during the investigation. Appeals must be heard by an Appeal Officer. The Appeal Officer may be any Coordinator or Deputy Coordinator not involved in the original proceeding. The Appeal Officer will review the findings of fact, investigation record, investigator recommendations, and adjudication letter to determine whether the appealed decision should be affirmed or reversed. The Appeal Officer must submit a written determination within fifteen (15) days of an appeal. Four Museums. One Membership.
